<!-- BEGIN MARKDOWN CONTENT: I can't control the formatting here, bleh -->      
<p>I struggled for a while trying to find the right <em>wow</em> words.  The one-liner that would hook you to read this.</p>

<blockquote><p>Real hacks, real exploits spelled out on TV.  No bullshit.</p></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Hollywood finally does hacking right.</p></blockquote>


<p>Ok, how about this one&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Anarchists take detailed notes, this is how you crash democracy (but you already knew this).</p></blockquote>


<p>Thought about going as far as&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>Pirating movies and songs immoral? You have no idea how immoral your society is.</p></blockquote>


<p>Ok, that last one needs a blog post on its own.  I am not an English major; I could not capture the jaw-drop I wanted in words.  In the end, I instead decided to show the world exactly just how accurate this show is.  How scarily accurate.</p>

<p>Buckle-up hackers and misfits.  Today starts a new era of my online exploits: <em>Mr. Robot: The facts of hacking.</em></p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Before we get to <em>Mr. Robot</em>, I want to explain a little about me and why I felt this is needed.  My friends and family know I have been warning them for decades of just how embedded our governments are with our online lives.</p>

<ul>
<li>The NSA spying for decades with backdoors in our routers and Internet Service Providers.</li>
<li>Automated filtering on network traffic, looking for key words.</li>
<li>Circumventing secure web connections with these backdoors into networks.</li>
<li>The underground phone recordings going on since the `70s, transcribing and flagging key words.</li>
<li>Public library (and now Amazon) tagging of special books checked out.</li>
</ul>


<p>The list goes on with several now publicly known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)" title="Global Surveillance programs">Global Surveillance programs</a> (and there&rsquo;s a lot more not public yet, keep that in mind).  When the Snowden leaks started, as the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to">RSA backdoor buyout</a> became public and many more, I couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling. This was the biggest silent, &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; ever.</p>

<p>I even joked in emails with my colleagues with &ldquo;Hello NSA!&rdquo; in emails because I entered keywords that I knew would be filtered.  Those emails date back to the &lsquo;90s btw.</p>

<p>My close personal colleague captured it best with a single question: <em>What is the price of freedom? <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to" title="RSA Backdoor $10 million">$10 million dollars</a></em></p>

<h3>TOR</h3>

<p>When my paranoia started to increase to levels of thoughts of deleting my MySpace/Facebook accounts, erasing my online presence, I looked into TOR in the mid `00s.  On the surface it looked perfect; but, once I read the technical details I saw the inherit flaws of the exit nodes and decided it wasn&rsquo;t the best approach for me to continue.</p>

<p>Though I continue to use TOR cautiously for only anonymous items (I don&rsquo;t log into any sites, use a private browser, etc), I highly advise everyone to think of TOR as a false sense of security and to be very cautious using it knowing its holes as you can easily be tracked if not careful.</p>

<p>Extreme details on TOR&rsquo;s security holes are in S01-E01 by the way.  I invite you to continue reading there.</p>

<h3>I sat on it</h3>

<p>Most of my hacks in the &lsquo;80s and 90s was nothing more than simple &ldquo;password guessing&rdquo;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_dialing">war dialers</a> and buffer overruns exploits of open ports.  Dirt simple hacks that an 12 year could do because, well, I was 12.</p>

<p>Even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking">Phone Phreaking</a> of the infamous tone hacks to dial BBSes overseas for free was fairly well known.  Out of all the blue boxes created, I only got one working.  Maybe because I was only 13 soldering these things myself in my basement while skipping school.</p>

<p>No one knew I was doing this; it was really a great time to learn computers.  Then came Internet-connected BBSes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_attack">Spoofing</a> which opened 1000s of servers to easy access (and hacks).</p>

<p><em>There was no reason to write a book on this stuff; no reason to share with the world.</em></p>

<p>Heck, even now with my 40 TB media system and Sickbeard, Couchpotato and SABnzbd automation, I very much hesitate writing blog posts on how easy it is to pirate these days.  I suppose my decision not to share these exploits came down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>If we tell the world how we are doing it, they will find ways to stop us.</li>
<li>The immorality stance that people take.</li>
</ul>


<p>Put a checkbox next to both of those as I have had my run-ins with them.  Though I never talked about it to frack us personally, others did and therefore they found ways to make it more difficult for us.  And immorality?  Don&rsquo;t talk to me about immorality when paying for your health plan and crossing the streets in NYC like everything is hunky dory.</p>

<p><em>Oblivious</em> is the keyword here.  Which brings now us to <em>Mr. Robot</em>&hellip;</p>

<h2>Mr. Robot</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the first 4 minutes of the pilot.</p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nJNZF3LR0VM " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>


<p>My jaw dropped.  Not because of the man and what he is doing..</p>

<p>No.  It was because of how perfectly accurate the technical bits were.  And not only accurate; but <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/11/silk-road/">considering recent events</a>, how up-to-date they really are.</p>

<p>If you are watching this series and think, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool.  But no way that can really happen.  TOR is anonymous.  It&rsquo;s just fiction.&rdquo;, well I am here to tell you its not.  After watching the first 4 episodes, every single line, hack, code, apk that you see is real &ndash; very real and 100% accurate (albeit some under the right conditions).</p>

<p>With that said I think the time is right to stand up and not to sit on this information any longer.  To show the world that this is not Hollywood magic &ndash; <em>this shit is real</em>.</p>

<p>I welcome everyone to come on a new journey with me: how to hack, as exploited by <em>Mr. Robot</em>.</p>

<h3>Episodes</h3>

<p>The way I envision this going is I will break down each episode and their technical facts and details.  And if I have the right environment, provide you with the details of the hack itself so you can educate yourself.</p>

<p>OT: Even the episode names themselves I think are a play on the recent attempts to keep people from downloading from newsgroups &ndash; absolute genius!  (in recent years, since the NNTP indexing sites have been threatened and shutdown, people are naming movies and tv shows oddly to bypass Hollywood-hired tech-lawyer&rsquo;s filters &ndash; in order to keep them from being &ldquo;nuked&rdquo;, aka DMCA taken down)</p>
