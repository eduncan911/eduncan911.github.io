## Other ways to help out

Besides the big-ass $5 PayPal green image above, I have a number of affiliate links that you can use below.  Picking one gives you props on Twitter.

### Get $25 Credit at Ting

[{% img http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Oti5LupeGCo/UR_VfZiN-uI/AAAAAAAAASU/1AYsQUt73EI/s1600/tingdashboard.jpg 'Ting me and get $25 credit!' 'Ting me and get $25 credit!' %}](https://zc7c9715lq2.ting.com/)

I switched my family from Sprint to Ting around May 2013 and have saved $980 so far
as of April 2014.  How are your cell phone bills?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Awesome... Another <a href="https://twitter.com/tingFTW">@TingFTW</a> referral. That&#39;s now almost two months free cell service for my family! Thx whoever u are!</p>&mdash; Eric Duncan (@eduncan911) <a href="https://twitter.com/eduncan911/statuses/453898728621867011">April 9, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You can get a $25 credit on any new device or towards your first bill
by using my affiliate code.  I will also get a $25 credit as well for referring
you!  It's a win-win.

Once you go Ting, you'll never go back.

To get $25 off, use my referral code by clicking [https://ting.com/r/zc7c9715lq2](https://ting.com/r/zc7c9715lq2).

### Dollar Shave Club

{% blockquote Michael Dubin, DSC Owner http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/ %}
Are the blades any good? 
No.  Our blades are f**cking great!
...
And do you think your razor needs a vibrating handle, a flashlight, a backscratcher and 10 blades?  Your handsome-ass grandfather had one blade, and polio.  
...
Stop paying for shave-tech you don't need.
{% endblockquote %}

As a proud member since 2012, [Dollar Shave Club](http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/eduncan911) is exactly what it sounds like - $1 blades; though, I usually opt for the $6 ones with free shipping.

[Use my affiliate link below](http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/eduncan911), and I'll get a $5 credit - just enough to buy a beer.

### Amazon Affiliate

If you shop Amazon a lot, you can use my referral code on your next purchase.  
It's pretty simple:

1. Come back to this page when you are ready to make a purchase
2. Click the Amazon banner above.
3. Make your purchase.

You can verify what I am doing by looking at the url.  You should see
something like:

### DNSimple for DNS

[{% img http://jasonseifer.com/assets/dnsimple.png 'DNSimple 2 months of free service' %}](https://dnsimple.com/r/101251903e88bc)

I have been purchasing domains since 1996 and using 3rd party DNS servers since 2002.
By far the best and most inexpensive I've used is DNSimple.  No more GoDaddy DNS 
outages, no more DNS delays - they really serve up to 1 minute TTL!

By using my referral, signing up and when you active your account you'll have 
two months of free service.

To use my referral and get two-months free, click [https://dnsimple.com/r/101251903e88bc](https://dnsimple.com/r/101251903e88bc).
