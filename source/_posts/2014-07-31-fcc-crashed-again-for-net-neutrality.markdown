A flood of comments about net neutrality crashed the Federal Communications Commission's commenting site on Tuesday, the original deadline for public comments on the controversial Internet proposal. But the tech problems are buying those who want to weigh in some extra time â€” the deadline for public commenting is now Friday (July 18th, 2014) at midnight.

Thank you everyone for [answering my call to crash the FCC](/technology/fcc/only-2-days-left-to-crash-the-fcc.html).  

Well, at least I'd like to think I had a hand in it with my awesome blog posts on the matter.  :)
