[Edward Snowden, The Dark Prophet](http://poy.time.com/2013/12/11/runner-up-edward-snowden-the-dark-prophet/)

I have largely remained mum on this subject except to my closest friends.  It wasn't until I read the Dec 23rd issue of Time on Snowden that I ran across a nice simple paragraph that touches on the more sensative facts of what has been going on, for the past 17 years, on the subject of the NSA and survalence.

The cell phone in your pocket records your movements and stores that information with your service carrier. The e-mail, chat and text messages you create map your social relations and record your thoughts. Credit-card purchases show spending habits and tastes. Mass-transit databases note when you board subways and buses with fare cards. The search terms you enter into your laptop — preserved by Google in ways that can be used to identify your computer for a standard period of nine months — may tell more about your deepest desires than anything you would ever admit to a friend or lover.

It really goes beyond that though.

Now as *The Internet of Things* becomes a reality (aka, smart devices such as refrigerators and your frontdoor lock), there already has been a number of hacks exploiting unsecure devices.

How about the NSA and what information they can gather on *The Internet of Things*?

Then there are the emerging technologies that will soon add even more information to the grid: The wearable-computing devices that monitor your pulse. The networked surveillance cameras rigged with facial-recognition software. The smart meters that record what time of night you turn out the lights. Retail companies like Nord­strom and Apple have debuted technologies that use your cell phones to track how long you linger before any single display. The possibilities are dizzying, and your information funds the whole enterprise. “Surveillance is the business model of the Internet,” explains Bruce Schneier, a security technologist who has access to some of the documents Snowden provided.

Let's dive deeper in this.
