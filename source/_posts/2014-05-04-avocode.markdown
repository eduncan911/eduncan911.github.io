ALWAYS BE IN SYNC
Share with a link and instantly get updates from your designer.
No more e-mail attachments or huge PSD uploads.

WEB & NATIVE APP
Preview and inspect PSDs on the web or use the native app
on any platform - Mac, Windows or even Linux.

EVERYTHING FROM A PSD
Choose anything from a PSD and get exactly what
you need – CSS, SVG, images, fonts or colors…

You know, I am starting to get that "designer" itch again.  I am not a designer; but, I can pull
something outta my ass every once in a while.  Going to try to get a private beta to see if
I can use this for some projects as well.
