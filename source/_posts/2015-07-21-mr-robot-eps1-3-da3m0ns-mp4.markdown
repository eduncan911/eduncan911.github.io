## RaspberryPi

Just a simple small computer that can run a full version of Linux. Connects to
a small 5V source and draws very little power.

What can you do with a Pi? It has what we call MIMO (Multi-In, Multi-Out) pin
connectors that you connect to any switch, relay, monitor, sensor and so on.

## The Plan

The plan is to raise the temperature of the climate control to above 95 F.
That can work as he is correct: the magnetic tape used to store media is quite
subject to high temps.

In reality though, most large data warehouses uses TB HDDs for PBs of storage redundant across multiple data facilities. The concept is called Disaster
Recovery: in the event of a disaster, you can recover from another facility by restoring data from the other location.

But let's not dwell on Hollywood: let's pretend Evil Corp does have only one
enormous data storage facility.

## Steal a Car

XX and XX sit on a bench with a frequency scanner, waiting on "mom" to press the
lock key on her remote. They capture the frequency and now they are able to
send an Unlock code on the same frequency. This gets the door unlocked.

Technically, this is true. There are many scanners on the market available that
can do exactly this and can be had for as little as $60. In reality, yes a lot
of mass produced vehicles used single frequency remotes.

However, most vehicles these days use multi-frequency hopping, to deter people from doing
exactly this. But even this is flawed as the algorithms for the 100 rotating frequencies
are known or can be known by reverse engineering the remote device and reading
the data on the chip to determine what pattern to use. Take that basic
algorithm, listen for what frequency was last sent and then just transmit on the
next one.

Here we are attempting to start the car and unlock the gear shifter and steering
wheel.

To do this hack requires

## Hack Hotel Room Doors

This is one of my favorite hacks. Not because I have spent several nights in a
comfty bed with this hack in the past; but, because I hand-built my device that
worked for years. Besides the 11-year old soldering I did on some of the earlier
phone freakin boxes, this device was one of my first professionally built
devices. I really loved that little box.

So how does this work?
