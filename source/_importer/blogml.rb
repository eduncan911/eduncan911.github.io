# BlogML import script originally sourced from:
#   https://github.com/philippkueng/philippkueng.github.com/tree/30ef1570f06d33938b18d5eee7767d6641b9a779/source/_import
# Best post I could find about how to use it was here:
#   http://philippkueng.ch/migrate-from-blogengine-dot-net-to-jekyll.html
#
# how to install
# --------------
#   mkdir source/.importer
#   cp blogml.rb to the source/._porter you created above
#   cp your BlogML.xml to the same source/_mporter directory
# 
# make sure to change the "categories" output at the end of this script
# to be the final resting place of your imported posts.  i chose to put mine
# all into the /blog/archives/ folder personally.  by using categories like
# this, it uses the folder structure for all posts to render in that one
# directory.
# 
# if you, on the other hand, want to retain your categories as categories
# in your new blog, feel free to remove the TAGs portion and copy it to the 
# CATEGORIES portion in the final output below.  It will render the categories
# per your BlogML.
#   
# how to run
# --------------
# I prefer this method below so you can run the importer multiple times without
# effecting any new and existing posts you may have created.  because the import
# BLOWS OUT YOUR _posts FOLDER!
#   cd source/_importer
#   ruby -r './blogml.rb' -e 'Jekyll::BlogML.process()'
#   
# that will execute the script only with that folder
# 
# change Log by eduncan911:
# 
# 2014-04-08
#   added "alias: " to output, changed old_url to be an array with the original old_url as well as a lowercased version
#   added "date: " to output
#   added "tags: " to output to read from categories (since I abused that 10 years ago)
#      you can change this to "categories: " easily and have the same array for them
#   added "published: " to output
#
