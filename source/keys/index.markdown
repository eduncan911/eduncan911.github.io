I have published my public PGP keys below for my two main email addresses.  I have also published my PGP keys in the [MIT directory pgp.mit.edu](http://pgp.mit.edu/) as well that are linked to the same email addresses.  If at any time I need to revoke a certificate, it will be revoked there.

I will also be on [Dark Mail](https://www.darkmail.info/) (if) and when it launches and will update this page with my public key(s) from it as well.

Therefore to keep up with any changes to my PGP and Dark Mail keys, you may want to [subscribe to updates of this page at GitHub](https://github.com/eduncan911/eduncan911.github.io/blob/master/keys/index.html).

``` text Verification Fingerprint
pub   rsa4096/5CE0F95AA510AA8C 2014-08-13 [SC]
Key fingerprint = 78A9 13EA AF81 2415 4B50  0B2A 5CE0 F95A A510 AA8C
Long Key ID     =                                   5CE0F95AA510AA8C
Short Key ID    =                                           A510AA8C
```

You can use my public key to send me encrypted messages and files.  The 
fingerprint is used to validate my identity (over video chat, in person, etc).

## Verifying Me: Eric Duncan, aka eduncan911

You can use the fingerprints above to verify the PGP key if you trust my website to be an authoritative source.

To verify that my website has not been tampered with, you may review the **commit history** on GitHub for any updates other than me along with the datetime of the last updates:

[https://github.com/eduncan911/eduncan911.github.io/blob/master/keys/index.html](https://github.com/eduncan911/eduncan911.github.io/blob/master/keys/index.html)

This link shows this actual page you are viewing right now as it is being hosted directly on GitHub Pages (GitHub served you this page, as you are reading it).  

Therefore, it can be safe to assume verification of my fingerprint by viewing any tampering or updates to this file in the **commit history** listed on GitHub.

My GitHub account is protected by two-factor authentication so you can assume that my username/password has not been compromised for an unauthorized update to this page.

## GnuPG Tips

I am archiving a list of `gpg2` commands I use from time to time for me when setting up new systems, generating new keys, revoking, etc.  Feel free to use them as you wish.

Most of these I have sourced from [Alan Eliasen](https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms) and I highly advise you read that link.

### Generate a New Key

``` bash Generate a PGP Key using GnuPG
gpg2 --gen-key
```

Make sure to pick 4096.

### Use Stronger Algorithms Before Posting the Public Key

These sets of commands will change the algorithm used even though GnuPG Version 2 already upgraded it to pretty strong ones.  That Version 2 upgrade though doesn't allow for older weaker encryptions possibly used by other addressees in the same email.  Therefore by setting the chain below, we stay compatible with older versions of GnuPG software that uses weaker algorithms by default that happen to be addressed in the same email (e.g. mostly Windows users).

``` bash Upgrade the Algorithms used
gpg2 --list-keys
gpg2 --interactive --edit-key your@email.address
gpg> showpref
gpg> setpref AES256 CAMELLIA256 AES192 CAMELLIA192 AES CAMELLIA128 TWOFISH CAST5 3DES SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 SHA1 RIPEMD160 MD5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
gpg> showpref
gpg> save
```

### Generate a Revocation Key

Be smart and generate a revocation key and store it indefinitely in a secure location so you don't look like an idiot.

``` bash Generate a Revocation Key
gpg2 --gen-revoke --armor --output=RevocationCertificate.asc your@email.address
```

### Export your Public Key to Share With Others

Now that you have updated the algorithms and setup a revocation certificate, your public key is ready to be published.

``` bash Get the Public Key
gpg2 --armor --export your@email.address
```

Save this to a file named something like `pubkey.asc`, as the `.asc` extension
tells others that this is in ASCII format.

### Uploading your Public Key to the WOT

You may want to publish your public key to online servers known as the Web of
Trust (WOT).  This creates the availability of your public key should you send
an email to someone that didn't include your public key.

First thing is, unlike most other commands here, you can only do this with your
*keyid* - not your email address.  Your *keyid* is located by looking at your
fingerprint and exporting a short keyid with it:

``` bash Short KEYID with Fingerprint 
gpg2 --fingerprint --keyid-format short your@email.address
pub   rsa4096/A510AA8C 2014-08-13 [SC]
...
```

In the output above, we can see my short KEYID is printed after 
the `rsa4096/` portion: **`A510AA8C`**.

We take this **`A510AA8C`** and issue a command to send your public key to the
servers.  Note: replace the *your-KEYID-here* with your short fingerprint.  E.g.
mine was A510AA8C in the example above.

``` bash Publish your Public Key
gpg2 --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys your-KEYID-here
```

### Fingerprint: Verifying Identities

So that others can verify your identity, generate a fingerprint that you can carry in your wallet, show over Skype video chat, etc.

``` bash Print your Fingerprint
gpg2 --fingerprint --keyid-format long your@email.address
```

Use the command above to print out the fingerprint of other people's fingerprint for verification.

### Backing up a Secret Key

One method is to export your key as ASCII that allows you to print it (for rescanning later as it would be error prone to type it manually), or to store it in a key store ([which in itself may be a bad idea](http://eduncan911.com/software/security/password-managers-are-not-immune-to-hacks-themselves.html)).

``` bash Exporting a Secret Key for Backup
gpg2 --export-secret-key --armor 
```

Optionally, you can specify `--output filename` to dump it to a file.

### Signing Someone's Public Key for Local Usage

So get rid of the warnings in email clients, signing the public key tells your system that you have verified and you trust the public key.

``` bash Signing a Public Key
gpg2 --sign-key their@email.address
```

Or for trusting someone on a low level:

``` bash Signing a Public Key, with Trust levels
gpg2 --interactive --edit-key their@email.address
gpg> sign
gpg> trust
gpg> save
gpg2 --export --armor their@email.address
```

### Import Someone's Signing of Your Public Key

After someone verifies who you are, they may want to send you a signed certificate.  You can import this signed certificate locally for any emails you send to them in the future.

``` bash Importing a Signed Key
gpg2 --import
```

### Locally Signing Someone's Key

If you don't care about verifying the identity of a person's public key, you can just locally signing their public key blindly ignoring it.

``` bash Blindly Sign Someone's Public key
gpg2 --lsign-key their@email.address
```

### Publishing your Public Key

You may want to publish your key using GnuPG's command line, especially to multiple servers.

``` bash Publishing your key
gpg2 --list-keys your@email.address
gpg2 --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-keys [KEYID]
```

The [Web of Trust](https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#WebOfTrust) dictates good practice of personally verifying someone's PGP keys by publishing your signed version of their PGP key publicly.  Once you sign their key using the procedures above, you can publishing their key using the same --send-keys method above.

### Encrypting a File

You can encrypt files using PGP.

``` bash Encrypt a File
gpg2 --encrypt --sign -r your@email.com filename
```

If you want to be able to decrypt the file in the future, you must add your own email address to the list of receiptents.  The `-r` does this for you.

But say you want to one-time encrypt something to send.  Most email clients keeps a **Sent** history (if you are sending it in email).  You don't want this!  What if your private key gets compromised and a few years goes past - then, someone with that old private key has the ability to decrypt that old email archived off in your Sent folder.

Therefore, you can omit your own email address.  Just remember you will never be able to decode it - ever.

Alternatively, you can encrypt it with --armor that will print out the contents in ASCII mode, making it easier to paste into a text file or email.

``` bash Encrypt a File with ASCII Output
gpg2 --armor --encrypt --sign -r your@email.com filename
```

## Summary

That's about it for the tips.  

There is a lot of reasons I skipped over that is listed on [Alan Eliasen](https://futureboy.us/pgp.html#StrongerAlgorithms)'s site.  I pretty much consider it required reading before I trust you as a PGP sender.
