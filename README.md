## eduncan911.com

This is the generated [Octopress source](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) of my blog.

If you wish to see the source and full configuration of my site, switch branches 
to [`source`](https://github.com/eduncan911/eduncan911.github.io/tree/source)
and you'll see a clone of [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) with my hacks.

### To Do

These are the items remaining before I can switch over.

* figure out directories (/categories, /tags etc)
* import all existing blog posts (there are tools for importing CSV, easy)
* redirect links for old urls (part of the importer process)
* basic 404.html
* port all blog image thumbnails/images over (or not?)
* figure out old /Downloads and /Binary folders (or not?)

### Nice to haves ...

These are the enhancements I plan on, after the requirements above.

* add several key plugins available, such as the Javascript Search feature (remember, this is static)
  * branch for plugin changes, to keep track of what goes in and changes
* enhance 404.html
  * theme like the categories page 
  * search box
  * maybe suggest posts based on some js wizardy
* port all /photos to flickr or some other gallery.  Doesn't belong on blog anyways.
* blog more
