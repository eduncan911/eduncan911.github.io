This is the generated static website of my blog.  If you are viewing eduncan911.com, this is the

If you wish to see the source and full configuration of my site, switch branches 
to [`source`](https://github.com/eduncan911/eduncan911.github.io/tree/source)
and you'll see a clone of [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) with all my hacks.


### Nice to haves ...

These are the enhancements I plan on when I have time.

* add several key plugins available, such as the Javascript Search feature (remember, this is static)
  * branch for plugin changes, to keep track of what goes in and changes
* enhance 404.html
  * theme like the categories page 
  * search box
  * maybe suggest posts based on some js wizardy
* port all /photos to flickr or some other gallery.  Doesn't belong on blog anyways.
