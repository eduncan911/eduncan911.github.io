    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was going through some old posts during my import and found where I mentioned that
<a href="/blog/archives/microsoft-to-build-its-own-cpus.html">Microsoft was to build their own CPUs</a>
for the next-gen Xbox after the 360 &ndash; nearly 8 years ago (yes, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360 is almost 9 years old</a>).</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The Xbox One&rsquo;s CPU component brings Microsoftâ€™s architecture of choice back to x86, just like the first-generation Xbox. This time, the company kicked IBM to the curb and opted not to jump into another Intel/Nvidia love triangle. Instead, it put a ring on AMD&rsquo;s finger, tapping the same source for general-purpose and graphics computing IP. At the same time, Sony was courting AMD&rsquo;s semi-custom division as well. Both competitors ended up sharing a bed, but due to NDAs was never caught laying down.</p><footer><strong>Tomshardware <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/microsoft-xbox-one-console-review</strong> <cite>3681-3.html">http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/microsoft-xbox-one-console-review</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Microsoft had Intel for Xbox 1st gen.  Then IBM for the 2nd gen.  For the 3rd gen Xbox One and PS4, we
all know <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6976/amds-jaguar-architecture-the-cpu-powering-xbox-one-playstation-4-kabini-temash">they went with AMD now</a>.</p>

<p>So this got me thinking&hellip; <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/cthacker/">Chuck Thacker is still at Microsoft</a>.  It does take a while to design and produce your CPU.  I wonder if Microsoft will drop that bomb in the next decade.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sad because after the Zune fiasco, with Zune software no longer compatible with
the Zune players, I&rsquo;m left with $600 in media players that are worthless and useless
cause I can&rsquo;t sync any music to them.  So I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever go back to
Microsoft products after that.  It was one too many low blows over the last decade.</p>

<p>In related news, a buddy of mine sums up how the Xbox One vs PS4 has played out over the last 6 months:</p>
