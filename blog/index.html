<p>I have several friends, CEOs, CTOs and even strangers tell me they can talk and drive, they can text and drive, they are good drivers, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always rebuttaled that the human brain can only focus on a single context, at any given time.</p>

<p>A quote in this story summed it up quite well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Earl Miller, a professor of neuroscience at MIT who specializes in multitasking, says this sounds like wishful thinking.</p><p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re monitoring the road at the same time, when actually what you&#8217;re doing [is] you&#8217;re relying on your brain&#8217;s prediction that nothing was there before, half a second ago — that nothing is there now,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But that&#8217;s an illusion. It can often lead to disastrous results.&#8221;</p><p>In other words, the brain fills in the gaps in what you see with memories of what you saw a half-second ago. Among scientists, that statement is not controversial. The politics of Google Glass — and where it&#8217;s worn — clearly is.</p><footer><strong>Does Google Glass Distract Drivers? The Debate Is On</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/03/24/289802359/does-google-glass-distract-drivers-the-debate-is-on'>www.npr.org/blogs/2014/03/24/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Bingo.  And this includes &ldquo;hands-free&rdquo; conversations as well as GPS.</p>

<p>Then again, in 30 years we may evolve to actually have our brains multi-task.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/hyper-anonymising-bitcoin-service-dark-wallet-launches-today/">Hyper-Anonymising Bitcoin Service ‘Dark Wallet’ Launches Today</a></p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ouo7Q6Cf_yc "></iframe></div>


<p>I first heard about this Dark Wallet protocol a few months ago when <a href="http://pando.com/2014/03/12/moving-on-up-bitcoin-gets-a-boost-as-new-york-opens-applications-for-virtual-currency-exchange-licenses/">New York state</a> announced they are regulating Bitcoin.  And recently when the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/04/03/IRS-Retroactively-Taxes-Bitcoin">IRS announced it is retroactively taxing Bitcoin as property</a>, the community brought up the Dark Wallet system again.</p>

<p>I have bitcoin and do not plan on paying any tax on it.  I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;buy&rdquo; any amount using taxable USD, and don&rsquo;t see a need for &ldquo;regulation.&rdquo;  Trying to tax my Bitcoin is basically using a gun to say I need to pay a tax on the open-source software I write: it has value to a select few, and is completely useless to most.</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="http://media.coindesk.com/2014/05/dark.jpg" title="'Bitcoin Dark Wallet'" ></p><p>The alpha version of Dark Wallet – the hyper-anonymising bitcoin wallet – goes live today.</p><p>Created by Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet provides new tools for financial privacy, including in-built coin mixing and ‘stealth’ wallet addresses.</p><p>As well as making it easier for people to disguise their transactions from the government, Dark Wallet is also a torpedo aimed at those in the bitcoin community who have embraced co-operation with regulators.</p><p>Conceived last year and partly funded by $50,000 raised on Indiegogo, the wallet was developed by unSystem, a collective of anarchist bitcoin developers. It represents an ethos that has been largely excluded from the mainstream discourse around bitcoin.</p><p>In January of this year, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk that bitcoin was “absolutely” moving away from its libertarian roots, and described attempts to avoid the regulation of bitcoin as playing into the hands of “anarchists and criminals”.</p><footer><strong>Hyper-Anonymising Bitcoin Service ‘Dark Wallet’ Launches Today</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.coindesk.com/hyper-anonymising-bitcoin-service-dark-wallet-launches-today/'>www.coindesk.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>And I personally liked this little nugget from the related article&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>If your goals are to create a sort of shadow financial system that runs in offshore jurisdictions and is attractive for anarchists and criminals, then maybe [regulation] is not important.</p><footer><strong>Jeremy Allaire via CoinDesk</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-abandons-anti-establishment-wall-street/'>www.coindesk.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The power to tax involves the power to destroy.</p>

<p>There is a new movement taking place in web development over the last few years.
It is called <code>static sites</code>. Just as it sounds, it is simply a collection of <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>, <code>.js</code> and images that serves up a complete site. What you may not know is that there are literately 100s of frameworks out there that generate these static sites for you from a single common theme/template.</p>

<h2>Static Site Generators</h2>

<p>I stumbled upon a collection of these frameworks here:</p>

<p><a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/">http://staticsitegenerators.net/</a></p>

<p>This is pure opinion, but it would seem that most of these frameworks came
out of the Linux/OSX world from developers that needed to generate a static site for this or that.  Those that did it often, needed a way to regenerate a whole static site by just changing, say, the header area.</p>

<p>I know that after my recent conversion to <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> (aka Jekyll) I have been brainstorming about my own static site generator.  As you can see in the link above, I am not the only one that had a similar thought.</p>

<h2>Advantages to Static Sites</h2>

<p>If you sit back and think about it, there are a number of advantages for running a static site.</p>

<h3>Hosting costs</h3>

<p>Can you really get any cheaper than free?  GitHub pages can host your static site for free.  If you really want to pay for something, then upload your static site files to Amazon S3 file storage and serve your site from there &ndash; for about $0.25/mo for 1000 uniques.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>You never have to worry about someone hacking your site.  No SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks.</p>

<p>Even if someone was to gain access to your hosting account, there is no database or code to hide backdoors in.</p>

<h3>Defacing</h3>

<p>If someone gains access to where you are storing the files and defaces the site, just redeploy &ndash; which overwrites everything.</p>

<h3>Simplicity (aka Serenity)</h3>

<p>It is just a bunch of html, images, css and js files.  You really can&rsquo;t get any simpler than that.</p>

<h2>How a static site becomes dynamic</h2>

<p>The real power behind these static sites is the interactions that the end user have on your site using 3rd party remote widgets.  It makes your site seem fairly dynamic by giving recent information. Just to give you an idea, here are a few widgets built into most of these frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flickr photo albums, single photos</li>
<li>Disqus commenting system</li>
<li>Google Forms/Surveys (aka Contact Us, product support, etc)</li>
<li>Stackexchange Profile</li>
<li>GitHub Profile</li>
<li>GitHub Repo browser</li>
<li>Twitter feed, single quotes</li>
<li>Sitemap generators</li>
</ul>


<p>&hellip;and a lot more.  By using these widgets, and carefully skinned to look like your site, it creates a dynamic site of sorts that continually updates even it really is a static site.</p>

<p>I use Google Forms here on my site as an example for my <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>.  It looks and feels like I actually did something on the backend to send me an email &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Customizing the generated output</h2>

<p>Almost all of these frameworks support plugins and extensions allowing for customizing the generated site to your preferences.  Basically these plugins work like this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Parse article/post content, usually on some plain-text form like Markdown</li>
<li>Process categories and tags</li>
<li>Redirects by creating <code>/old-url/index.html</code> kind of pages</li>
<li>Code highlighting</li>
<li>Pagination</li>
</ul>


<p>And so on.  Perhaps an indicator of the quality of the framework is the article/post/page parser with its extensions built into it, and how extensible it is.  Take Octopress for example, it has butt load:</p>

<ul>
<li>blockquote</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>date</li>
<li>GitHub gist</li>
<li>img</li>
<li>pullquote</li>
<li>video</li>
</ul>


<p>Creating your own tag is fairly straight forward using a well documented Liquid Template parser for ruby.</p>

<h2>Speeding up writing is key (for me at least)</h2>

<p>I am now free to write my thoughts in any place I can write notepad.  I insert things like <code>{% blockquote %}</code> and write a small blurb and I&rsquo;m done.  I&rsquo;ve been wanting to switch to Markdown since I started using it with Unfuddle many many years ago, and now I can.</p>

<p>If this post made you think about making more sites static, drop me a line in the comments below.</p>

<p><a href="https://ting.com/blog/drop-your-data-challenge-get-ready/">Ting tries to bring your mobile data into focus</a></p>

<blockquote><p><img src="https://ting.com/wp-content/uploads/image_dropdata.png" title="&#34;Ting Drop Your Data&#34;" alt="&#34;Ting Drop Your Data&#34;"></p><p>On May 5 we’re launching a “Drop your Data” contest and challenging you to use as little mobile data as you possibly can. While we want you to think about reducing your data usage, we don’t mean using your smartphone less – there are many ways to conserve data without sacrificing your mobile phone experience. Take simple steps like connecting to Wi-Fi at home and at work, downloading your favorite audio and video podcasts automatically on Wi-Fi and so on.</p><p>The contest will be set up in two, week-long intervals and will utilize Onavo Count (Android/iPhone), a nifty data reporting app. The first week, you’ll use your smartphone as you normally would, and then for the second week, work on cutting down your mobile data usage! Open to customers and non-customers alike, all participants will be entered in a random draw to win $1,000 cash or one of three $150 Ting credits!</p><p>Don’t want to use Onavo Count? That’s fine. You can use the native data counting options on your phone or another counting method. Just ensure that the screenshots you submit clearly show the time period and your mobile data use (not Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi plus mobile data) for the time period.</p><p>If you’re not currently a Ting customer, you’ll also receive service credit for your percentage of data savings from the first week to the second. In other words, if you cut your mobile data use by 74%, you’ll receive a $74 Ting credit.</p><p><img src="https://ting.com/wp-content/uploads/datasaving.png" title="&#34;save mobile data&#34;" alt="&#34;save mobile data&#34;"></p><p>Stay tuned for complete details inside this blog post on Monday, May 5.</p></blockquote>


<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve carefully been monitoring my data usage for years because I value battery life
over &ldquo;always connected&rdquo; distractions, I&rsquo;ll be entering this contest to see if I can drop it even
further.  Challenge accepted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Ting user for nearly 1 year now, have saved over $1000 (which already paid for our new phones,
canceling our contracts, and then some) and cannot live without the real-time stats and alerts they
have.</p>

<p>I like how they invite people that are not Ting users to enter the contest as well.</p>

<p>I was going through some old posts during my import and found where I mentioned that
<a href="/blog/archives/microsoft-to-build-its-own-cpus.html">Microsoft was to build their own CPUs</a>
for the next-gen Xbox after the 360 &ndash; nearly 8 years ago (yes, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360 is almost 9 years old</a>).</p>

<blockquote><p>The Xbox One&#8217;s CPU component brings Microsoft’s architecture of choice back to x86, just like the first-generation Xbox. This time, the company kicked IBM to the curb and opted not to jump into another Intel/Nvidia love triangle. Instead, it put a ring on AMD&#8217;s finger, tapping the same source for general-purpose and graphics computing IP. At the same time, Sony was courting AMD&#8217;s semi-custom division as well. Both competitors ended up sharing a bed, but due to NDAs was never caught laying down.</p><footer><strong>Tomshardware</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/microsoft-xbox-one-console-review,3681-3.html'>Xbox One Review: Unifying Your Living Room Experience</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Microsoft had Intel for Xbox 1st gen.  Then IBM for the 2nd gen.  For the 3rd gen Xbox One and PS4, we
all know <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6976/amds-jaguar-architecture-the-cpu-powering-xbox-one-playstation-4-kabini-temash">they went with AMD now</a>.</p>

<p>So this got me thinking&hellip; <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/cthacker/">Chuck Thacker is still at Microsoft</a>.  It does take a while to design and produce your CPU.  I wonder if Microsoft will drop that bomb in the next decade.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s sad because after the Zune fiasco, with Zune software no longer compatible with
the Zune players, I&rsquo;m left with $600 in media players that are worthless and useless
cause I can&rsquo;t sync any music to them.  So I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever go back to
Microsoft products after that.  It was one too many low blows over the last decade.</p>

<p>In related news, a buddy of mine sums up how the Xbox One vs PS4 has played out over the last 6 months:</p>

<p>There are many benefits to both your readers and yourself if you were to put your
blog under source revisions.  I would go as far to say that you own it to the community
to publish all revisions of your blog that was ever public for pure archiving reasons.</p>

<p>You can try browsing the images in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eduncan911/sets/72157600808141363/">my Flickr set called Blogs</a>
for the one you were looking for; but alas, I didn&rsquo;t upload all photos (sorry Venna White fans).</p>

<p>Fret not.  If you really need that photo, just use the contact button at in the header and/or footer

<p>I recently abandoned my 14 year dedication to Dell laptops in favor of the
Lenovo Helix ultrabook/tablet.  In doing so, I needed a stylus for the active
digitizer as the one that came with the Helix just isn&rsquo;t going to work for
diagramming and sketching.</p>

<p>As announced previously, I&rsquo;ve recently <a href="/software/my-hackers-blog.html">converted my blog over to Octopress</a>.
This was not without a few stumbling blocks on Windows using Posh-Git.  I&rsquo;ve also recently started to suspect some issues
with <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">Posh-Git</a> now that I am using it on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In this post, I am documenting the procedure for future installs on Windows; and, maybe I can help someone else who runs across the
same issues.</p>
