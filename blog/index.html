<p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/awesomer/facts-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-star-wars-movies">58 Facts You Probably Didn&rsquo;t Know About The Star Wars Movies</a></p>

<blockquote><p>1. The actor who played Obi-Wan Kenobi, Alec Guiness, thought of the Star Wars films as “fairy-tale rubbish”.</p><p>2. Despite this, he negotiated a deal to earn 2% of the gross box office receipts for the movies he appeared in, earning him over $95 million.</p><p>3. Harrison Ford was paid $10,000 for his performance in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.</p><p>4. Peter Cushing, who played Grand Moff Tarkin, found his costume boots so uncomfortable that he wore slippers during many of his scenes, and insisted his feet just never be in the shots.</p><p>5. The sound of the TIE Fighter engines is actually the sound of an elephant call mixed with the sounds of a car driving on wet pavement.</p><p>6. Steven Spielberg made a bet with George Lucas for a percentage of the Star Wars films, which has earned him millions of dollars since.</p><p>7. While shooting the scene in the trash compactor, Mark Hamill held his breath for so long that he burst a blood vessel in the side of his face. They had to adjust framing while shooting the rest of the scene to avoid showing the blemish.</p><p>8. Many of the buildings constructed to be used in shots of Tatooine are still standing in Tunisia. In fact, some of them are still used by locals.</p><p>9. Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles, is Ewan McGregor’s uncle.</p><p>10. Luke Skywalker was originally going to be named Luke Starkiller, and retained the name up until the film begin shooting. Luckily, the name was never mentioned, so it was changed to Skywalker with little effort.</p><p>11. The starship that became the Blockade Runner seen at the beginning of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope was the original design for the Millennium Falcon.</p><p>12. The Jawa language is based on a sped-up version of the Zulu language.</p><p>13. The language Greedo speaks is a South American language called Quechua.</p><p>14. The bounty hunter Bossk’s clothing is a recycled spacesuit from Doctor Who.</p><p>15. Yoda’s species has never been named.</p><p>16. Mark Hamill was in a bad car accident before filming started on Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, causing severe facial trauma. The scene in which Luke Skywalker is mauled by a Wampa was added to account for the scarring on his face.</p><p>17. Yoda was originally going to played by a monkey carrying a cane and wearing a mask.</p><p>18. During the evacuation of Cloud City, you can see an extra running with what appears to be an ice cream maker. The extra has since been given an elaborate backstory, and the supposed ice cream maker is meant to be a database of contacts within the Rebellion.</p><p>19. The word “ewok” is never said out loud in the Star Wars movies.</p><p>20. Luke’s lightsaber in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi was originally going to be blue to match the lightsaber he lost in the previous film, but George Lucas was worried that it would confuse audiences, and thought a green lightsaber would look better, so he made the change.</p><p>21. At one point, Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi was going to be called “Revenge of the Jedi” and there were actually trailers and posters produced with the original title.</p><p>22. In fact, the producers of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan changed the name of their film from “Revenge of Khan” to avoid confusion between the two films.</p><p>23. The bounty hunter droid IG-88 was actually built from recycled film props. His head is the drink dispenser from the cantina scene in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.</p><p>24. Three of the aliens seen on Jabba’s barge in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi are named Klaatu, Barada, and Nikto. Their names are a referenced in Army Of Darkness as the words one must say to destroy the book of the dead. The names themselves are a reference to the words that must be spoken to shut down the robot in The Day the Earth Stood Still.</p><p>25. While filming Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, the codename for the project was Blue Harvest, which was supposed to be a horror film with the tagline “horror beyond imagination.”</p><p>26. The cast actually seriously considered making Blue Harvest when a series of sandstorms halted filming for several days.</p><p>27. Blue Harvest is a reference to the 1929 novel “Red Harvest,” which was the inspiration for the film Yojimbo, which itself was inspiration for the Star Wars films.</p><p>28. In one draft of Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda were going to leave the Force, and return to their physical bodies again to either assist Luke in his confrontation with Darth Vader and the Emperor, or to join him during the celebration on Endor.</p><p>29. Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace was labelled as “The Doll House” when it shipped to theaters.</p><p>30. No physical clone trooper outfits were actually produced for the films. Every clone trooper seen in the Star Wars films was created with CGI.</p><p>31. The communicator Qui-Gon Jinn uses is actually an altered Gillete Sensor Excel women’s razor.</p><p>32. Samuel L. Jackson claims that the words “bad motherfucker” were engraved on the lightsaber he used in the Star Wars films.</p><p>33. While filming lightsaber fight scenes, Ewan McGregor kept getting carried away and making the sounds of the weapon himself, which had to be removed in post-production.</p><p>34. Tupac Shakur auditioned for the role of Mace Windu.</p><p>35. An early draft of the Star Wars saga began with “This is the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi-bendu of Opuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, a padawan learner of the famed Jedi.” It wasn’t until Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace that Mace Windu and Padawans first made an appearance.</p><p>36. The waterfalls cascading around the capital city of Naboo was actually salt.</p><p>37. Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones was labelled as “Cue Ball” when it shipped to theaters.</p><p>38. The cow-like creature seen grazing in the fields behind Anakin and Padmé in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones can be seen again as an asteroid later in the film.</p><p>39. The members of NSYNC made a cameo in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones to appease George Lucas’ daughters, but the scene was cut from the final version of the film.</p><p>40. Ahmed Best, the actor that plays Jar Jar Binks, makes an appearance out of costume in the background of one scene.</p><p>41. So does Anthony Daniels, who plays C-3PO.</p><p>42. George Lucas’ daughter Katie Lucas appears as a Twi’lek dancer in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones.</p><p>43. Her sister, Amanda Lucas, appears as a background extra.</p><p>44. Their brother, Jett Lucas, appears as a young Padawan in the Jedi archives.</p><p>45. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was labelled as “The Bridge” when it shipped to theaters.</p><p>46. While standing in on the Galactic Senate, Jar Jar Binks votes in favor of Order 66, leading to the destruction of the Jedi and the rise of the Galactic Empire. Even more reason to hate him.</p><p>47. The top-down shot of a severely burned Anakin Skywalker near the end of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith has the character framed within the symbol of the Galactic Empire.</p><p>48. The in-universe name for the genre of music heard during the cantina scene is “jizz.”</p><p>49. Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder, which is one more than is required to make the diagnosis.</p><p>50. Lucasfilm has someone on staff whose job is just to maintain Star Wars canon.</p><p>51. E.T.’s alien species are part of the Star Wars universe. A delegation of the aliens can be seen in the Galactic Senate.</p><p>52. In an early draft of the Star Wars story, R2-D2 speaks standard English, and is actually kind of a jerk.</p><p>53. George Lucas came up with the name R2-D2 while filming American Graffiti. A member of the sound crew asked him to retrieve reel #2 of the second dialogue track, which in the parlance would be, “Could you get R2-D2 for me?”</p><p>54. The phrase “I have a bad feeling about this” is said in every film.</p><p>55. There’s an island nation called Niue that accepts collectible Star Wars coins.</p><p>56. Every Star Wars film has been released the week after George Lucas’ birthday on May 14.</p><p>57. Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader has been played by six different people: David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Bob Anderson, Sebastian Shaw, Jake Lloyd, and Hayden Christensen.</p><p>58. A disco version of the Star Wars theme became a No. 1 hit in 1977, and held the spot for two weeks.</p><p><div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uJ3kV3Icm28 "></iframe></div></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/general-interest/vibram-agrees-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit">Vibram Agrees to Settle Class Action Lawsuit Claiming Company Deceived Consumers</a></p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/fivefingers_shoes.jpg" title="FiveFinger Vibram Shoes" ></p>

<blockquote><p>Vibram USA, the company that makes FiveFingers running shoes, has agreed to settle a lawsuit that alleged the company made false and unsubstantiated claims about the health benefits of its glove-like footwear. According to the court filings, Vibram settled to put the matter to rest and avoid any additional legal expenses. “Vibram expressly denied and continues to deny any wrongdoing alleged in the Actions, and neither admits nor concedes any actual or potential fault, wrongdoing or liability,” read the court brief.</p><p>Valerie Bezdek brought the class action suit against Vibram in March 2012.  She filed her complaint in Massachusetts, the state where Vibram’s U.S. headquarters are located. Bezdek alleged that Vibram deceived consumers by advertising that the footwear could reduce foot injuries and strengthen foot muscles, without basing those assertions on any scientific merit. “The gist of her claim is that Vibram illegally obtained an economic windfall from her because it was only by making false health claims that Vibram induced consumers to buy FiveFingers shoes, and to pay more for them than they would have otherwise[.]”</p><footer><strong>Matt McCue</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.runnersworld.com/general-interest/vibram-agrees-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit'>Vibram Agrees to Settle Class Action Lawsuit</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I get the whole false claims thing that it could reduce foot injuries which wasn&rsquo;t based on any facts.  Just seems silly to see lawsuits like this after all this time based on mis-representation in advertising.  America, the land of the <em>litigated</em>.</p>

<p>A quick Google for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Valerie+Bezdek&amp;num=50&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hfhrU8uIJ6fesATAs4DgDQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1211&amp;bih=852">Valerie Bezdek</a> shows someone proud of her FiveFingers shoes.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot live without my FiveFingers shoes.  I&rsquo;ve had them for a little over 2 years now and keep using them (I got the extra durable ones).  Before getting them I was already <a href="http://zenhabits.net/barefoot-running/">running barefooted on the balls of my feet</a>, for proper technique.  I got these and they have allowed me to run in more places &ndash; again, on the balls of my feet, not my heel.</p>

<p>I can easily see those that don&rsquo;t run on the balls of their feet getting injuries.</p>

<p>In the end, if you want to submit a claim the url will be:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fivefingerssettlement.com">http://www.fivefingerssettlement.com</a></p>

<p>In addition, it seems people who wear these shoes are thought of as snobs?  Give me a break.</p>

<p>I remember an NPR segment from around ~2008 when I moved to New York hot on the heels of the 2nd generation iPhone, the 3G.  It talked about our society was already significantly affected by the 1st gen iPhone in that we were becoming a race of robots, always starring down at our smartphone.</p>

<p>It went as far as to say how rude it is to look down at your phone at dinner, or while someone was talking to you.  It made a good case about social interactions > your email, to the point of branding you a jackass if you did it.</p>

<p>That segment (sorry, can&rsquo;t find it) changed my view entirely on social interactions and made me overly conscience on my &ldquo;mobile use&rdquo;, along with observing others and their &ldquo;mobile habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried not to be the asshole that said, &ldquo;Hey, put down your phone and look at me.&rdquo;  Instead, I used other hints that were in the NPR segment such as when noticing someone is paying attention to their mobile device and not looking at you while you are talking, just pause your sentence.  You&rsquo;ll find out that on average 5 seconds go by until they &ldquo;Look Up.&rdquo; Or, you could simply offer a visual clue that they have to focus on.</p>

<p>I am happy to report that after 6 years of this, I find myself placing my smartphone on the table yes; but, I do not do this to monitor it or look at it.  I do this to get the huge 5&#8221; screen bulk + bumper cover out of my pocket so I can sit down.  I place it face down so not to disturb me and to give complete focus to the person(s) I am sitting with.  I am happy to report that some even have had taken notice and started to do the same, even coming back to report to me how it changed their social interactions.</p>

<p>Fast forward to my nearly 3 year old daughter I have now, and this video.  I&rsquo;ve reviewed the results of quite a lot of studies on child raising and these tablets and smartphones.  It basically came down to one thing:</p>

<blockquote><p>Make it a learning experience for the child and learn together with them.  Do not use as an entertainment device and do not leave them alone with it.</p></blockquote>


<p>In addition, I take my daughter to the playground in the park often.  The vast majority of the time, there are no kids &ndash; we are the only ones there.  We experience <em>the swings hanging still</em> all too often &ndash; until we jump into them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/02/responsive-design-begins-with-the-url/">Responsive Design Begins with the URL</a></p>

<blockquote><p><img src="/blog/images/responsive-design-url-schema.jpg" title="&#34;Responsive Design URL Schema&#34;" alt="&#34;Responsive Design URL Schema&#34;"></p><p>The core principle in creating a potentially enormous website that will last forever is to get the information architecture right in the first place. This involves knowing your data objects and how they fit together. It should also determine the URL structure, which for Programmes is the most important aspect. Take the URL for Top Gear’s home page:</p><p>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mj59</p><p>After the domain name comes the word “programmes,” which is a simple, unchanging English word. It is intended to describe the object, and is not a brand or product name. Plurals are used so that the URL can be hacked backwards to retrieve an index.</p><p>Next is the programme identifier. Note the lack of hierarchy and the lack of a title. Titles change over time, and many programmes do not have a unique title, which would cause a clash. Hierarchies also change — a one-off pilot could be commissioned for a full series. Understanding your objects allows you to recognize what is permanent. In this case, nothing is particularly guaranteed to be permanent, so a simple ID is used instead. Users aren’t expected to type these URLs, though. They will usually arrive through a search engine or by typing in a friendly redirect that has been read out on air, such as bbc.co.uk/topgear. But the key principle of a permanent URL is that inward links are trusted to be shareable and work forever. Cool URIs don’t change.</p><p>A clear information architecture defines the URL scheme. A piece of content is given a clear canonical home, where appropriate. Links and aggregations between them then clearly appear.</p><footer><strong>David Marland</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/02/responsive-design-begins-with-the-url'>Responsive Design Begins With the URL</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>For a decade I have spent a considerable amount of time getting the URLs <em>right</em> for what the user was looking at.  I must have gone through 20 different iterations over the years trying out all sorts of designs, deep linking, &ldquo;walk the url backwards&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>You can see on my static site blog here that I paid close attention as well, trying out yet another theme.  I am on my 4th iteration of a url schema for my blog and it has become a PITA when having to keep redirects working of old urls, especially on <a href="https://github.com/eduncan911/eduncan911.github.io/tree/master/blog">this static site with no URL rewrite module</a>.</p>

<p>I almost went the <em>post_id</em> route here on this iteration; but, Jekyll (and therefore Octopress) makes the title url-safe already so I kept it.  Besides that, I agree that urls should play a role in your web architecture.</p>

<p>As long as we are talking about it, ASP.NET MVC&rsquo;s default <code>/Controller/Action/Id</code> has always pissed me off since I first started using it back in 2007.  Coming from a pure-RESTful background, the pure REST urls are more similar to <code>/Controller/Id/Action</code> so you end up with urls like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>/product/2832/
</span><span class='line'>/product/2832/edit
</span><span class='line'>/product/2832/clips
</span><span class='line'>/product/2832/videos</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And so on.  Which, actually, falls inline with what the BBC article above was saying.</p>

<p>I have several friends, CEOs, CTOs and even strangers tell me they can talk and drive, they can text and drive, they are good drivers, etc.</p>

<p>A quote in this story summed it up quite well:</p>

<blockquote><p>Earl Miller, a professor of neuroscience at MIT who specializes in multitasking, says this sounds like wishful thinking.</p><p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re monitoring the road at the same time, when actually what you&#8217;re doing [is] you&#8217;re relying on your brain&#8217;s prediction that nothing was there before, half a second ago — that nothing is there now,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But that&#8217;s an illusion. It can often lead to disastrous results.&#8221;</p><p>In other words, the brain fills in the gaps in what you see with memories of what you saw a half-second ago. Among scientists, that statement is not controversial. The politics of Google Glass — and where it&#8217;s worn — clearly is.</p><footer><strong>Does Google Glass Distract Drivers? The Debate Is On</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/03/24/289802359/does-google-glass-distract-drivers-the-debate-is-on'>www.npr.org/blogs/2014/03/24/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Bingo.  And this includes &ldquo;hands-free&rdquo; conversations as well as GPS.</p>

<p>Then again, in 30 years we may evolve to actually have our brains multi-task.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.coindesk.com/hyper-anonymising-bitcoin-service-dark-wallet-launches-today/">Hyper-Anonymising Bitcoin Service ‘Dark Wallet’ Launches Today</a></p>

<div class="embed-video-container"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ouo7Q6Cf_yc "></iframe></div>


<p>I first heard about this Dark Wallet protocol a few months ago when <a href="http://pando.com/2014/03/12/moving-on-up-bitcoin-gets-a-boost-as-new-york-opens-applications-for-virtual-currency-exchange-licenses/">New York state</a> announced they are regulating Bitcoin.  And recently when the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/04/03/IRS-Retroactively-Taxes-Bitcoin">IRS announced it is retroactively taxing Bitcoin as property</a>, the community brought up the Dark Wallet system again.</p>

<p>I have bitcoin and do not plan on paying any tax on it.  I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;buy&rdquo; any amount using taxable USD, and don&rsquo;t see a need for &ldquo;regulation.&rdquo;  Trying to tax my Bitcoin is basically using a gun to say I need to pay a tax on the open-source software I write: it has value to a select few, and is completely useless to most.</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="http://media.coindesk.com/2014/05/dark.jpg" title="'Bitcoin Dark Wallet'" ></p><p>The alpha version of Dark Wallet – the hyper-anonymising bitcoin wallet – goes live today.</p><p>Created by Amir Taaki and Cody Wilson, Dark Wallet provides new tools for financial privacy, including in-built coin mixing and ‘stealth’ wallet addresses.</p><p>As well as making it easier for people to disguise their transactions from the government, Dark Wallet is also a torpedo aimed at those in the bitcoin community who have embraced co-operation with regulators.</p><p>Conceived last year and partly funded by $50,000 raised on Indiegogo, the wallet was developed by unSystem, a collective of anarchist bitcoin developers. It represents an ethos that has been largely excluded from the mainstream discourse around bitcoin.</p><p>In January of this year, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told CoinDesk that bitcoin was “absolutely” moving away from its libertarian roots, and described attempts to avoid the regulation of bitcoin as playing into the hands of “anarchists and criminals”.</p><footer><strong>Hyper-Anonymising Bitcoin Service ‘Dark Wallet’ Launches Today</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.coindesk.com/hyper-anonymising-bitcoin-service-dark-wallet-launches-today/'>www.coindesk.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>And I personally liked this little nugget from the related article&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>If your goals are to create a sort of shadow financial system that runs in offshore jurisdictions and is attractive for anarchists and criminals, then maybe [regulation] is not important.</p><footer><strong>Jeremy Allaire via CoinDesk</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-abandons-anti-establishment-wall-street/'>www.coindesk.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The power to tax involves the power to destroy.</p>

<!-- BEGIN MARKDOWN CONTENT: I can't control the formatting here, bleh -->      

<p>There is a new movement taking place in web development over the last few years.
It is called <code>static sites</code>. Just as it sounds, it is simply a collection of <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>, <code>.js</code> and images that serves up a complete site. What you may not know is that there are literately 100s of frameworks out there that generate these static sites for you from a single common theme/template.</p>

<h2>Static Site Generators</h2>

<p>I stumbled upon a collection of these frameworks here:</p>

<p><a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/">http://staticsitegenerators.net/</a></p>

<p>This is pure opinion, but it would seem that most of these frameworks came
out of the Linux/OSX world from developers that needed to generate a static site for this or that.  Those that did it often, needed a way to regenerate a whole static site by just changing, say, the header area.</p>

<p>I know that after my recent conversion to <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> (aka Jekyll) I have been brainstorming about my own static site generator.  As you can see in the link above, I am not the only one that had a similar thought.</p>

<h2>Advantages to Static Sites</h2>

<p>If you sit back and think about it, there are a number of advantages for running a static site.</p>

<h3>Hosting costs</h3>

<p>Can you really get any cheaper than free?  GitHub pages can host your static site for free.  If you really want to pay for something, then upload your static site files to Amazon S3 file storage and serve your site from there &ndash; for about $0.25/mo for 1000 uniques.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>You never have to worry about someone hacking your site.  No SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks.</p>

<p>Even if someone was to gain access to your hosting account, there is no database or code to hide backdoors in.</p>

<h3>Defacing</h3>

<p>If someone gains access to where you are storing the files and defaces the site, just redeploy &ndash; which overwrites everything.</p>

<h3>Simplicity (aka Serenity)</h3>

<p>It is just a bunch of html, images, css and js files.  You really can&rsquo;t get any simpler than that.</p>

<h2>How a static site becomes dynamic</h2>

<p>The real power behind these static sites is the interactions that the end user have on your site using 3rd party remote widgets.  It makes your site seem fairly dynamic by giving recent information. Just to give you an idea, here are a few widgets built into most of these frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flickr photo albums, single photos</li>
<li>Disqus commenting system</li>
<li>Google Forms/Surveys (aka Contact Us, product support, etc)</li>
<li>Stackexchange Profile</li>
<li>GitHub Profile</li>
<li>GitHub Repo browser</li>
<li>Twitter feed, single quotes</li>
<li>Sitemap generators</li>
</ul>


<p>&hellip;and a lot more.  By using these widgets, and carefully skinned to look like your site, it creates a dynamic site of sorts that continually updates even it really is a static site.</p>

<p>I use Google Forms here on my site as an example for my <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>.  It looks and feels like I actually did something on the backend to send me an email &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>Customizing the generated output</h2>

<p>Almost all of these frameworks support plugins and extensions allowing for customizing the generated site to your preferences.  Basically these plugins work like this.</p>

<ul>
<li>Parse article/post content, usually on some plain-text form like Markdown</li>
<li>Process categories and tags</li>
<li>Redirects by creating <code>/old-url/index.html</code> kind of pages</li>
<li>Code highlighting</li>
<li>Pagination</li>
</ul>


<p>And so on.  Perhaps an indicator of the quality of the framework is the article/post/page parser with its extensions built into it, and how extensible it is.  Take Octopress for example, it has butt load:</p>

<ul>
<li>blockquote</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>date</li>
<li>GitHub gist</li>
<li>img</li>
<li>pullquote</li>
<li>video</li>
</ul>


<p>Creating your own tag is fairly straight forward using a well documented Liquid Template parser for ruby.</p>

<h2>Speeding up writing is key (for me at least)</h2>

<p>I am now free to write my thoughts in any place I can write notepad.  I insert things like <code>{% blockquote %}</code> and write a small blurb and I&rsquo;m done.  I&rsquo;ve been wanting to switch to Markdown since I started using it with Unfuddle many many years ago, and now I can.</p>

<p>If this post made you think about making more sites static, drop me a line in the comments below.</p>
