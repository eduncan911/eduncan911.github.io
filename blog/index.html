<p>Heard this on NPR and decided to investigate further because at first glance it looks like a good idea &ndash; at least from a developer&rsquo;s perspective.</p>

<p>From the PaymentNews website, I found this announcement.</p>

<blockquote><p>Tokenization is the process of replacing a traditional card account number with a unique payment token that is restricted in how it can be used with a specific device, merchant, transaction type or channel. When using tokenization, merchants and digital wallet operators do not need to store card account numbers; instead they are able to store payment tokens that can only be used for their designated purpose. The tokenization process happens in the background in a manner that is expected to be invisible to the consumer.</p><footer><strong>EMVCo to Work on Payment Tokenization Standards</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.paymentsnews.com/2014/01/emvco-to-work-on-payment-tokenization-standards.html'>www.paymentsnews.com/2014/01/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Visa calls it, <a href="https://checkout.visa.com/index.jsp?country=US">VISA checkout</a> and it is supposed to remove the burden of entering a credit card from your smartpohone.</p>

<p>Looking better.  But wait a minute, how do you secure/access a token?</p>

<p>Turns out they are expecting users to sign in with a &ldquo;<em>simple username and password, easy to remember</em>.&rdquo;  And there inlies my first cringe &ndash; passwords?  Let me explain why that is a roadblock IMO:</p>

<ul>
<li>Either the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_policy">password requirements</a> will be a road block for anyone to easily type or remember.</li>
<li>Or, the password will be a weaker password &ndash; easy for people to remember, and also to reuse for, say, a forum login <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5853483/a-guide-to-sniffing-out-passwords-and-cookies-and-how-to-protect-yourself-against-it">that can easily get sniffed</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sure, you can mitigate the complex passwords with a password manager.  But, not everyone uses those and some would argue <a href="/software/security/password-managers-are-not-immune-to-hacks-themselves.html">a password manager is also a bad idea</a>.</p>

<p>Today if presented with an &ldquo;enter credit card details below&rdquo; with an option to &ldquo;sign in with Visa Checkout instead&rdquo;, I still enter the raw CC details.  Which that in and of itself is the problem VISA is trying to fix by focusing the burden on secure storage of those CC details with VISA themselves, instead of the mom-n-pop cake shop&rsquo;s PHP website that is asking for my CC.</p>

<p>What I would suggest is to take a more two-factor approach to authentication.  Something that involves a simple password, one that is easy to remember; but also, you need to have a second factor of authentication &ndash; like a keyfob or fingerprint reader or possibly even, gasp, something as simple as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator">Google&rsquo;s Authenticator</a> that has worked perfectly for me for many websites and devices.</p>

<p>But sadly, we will continue to be forced to obey the <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2010/09/10/2003482490">false sense of security of complex passwords</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for <a href="/technology/fcc/only-2-days-left-to-crash-the-fcc.html">answering my call to crash the FCC</a>.</p>

<p>Well, at least I&rsquo;d like to think I had a hand in it with my awesome blog posts on the matter.  :)</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our attacks are severe: in four out of the five password managers we studied (LastPass, RoboForm, My1login, PasswordBox, and NeedMyPassword), an attacker can learn a userâ€™s credentials for arbitrary websites. We find vulnerabilities in diverse features like one-time passwords, bookmarklets, and shared passwords. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities are also diverse: ranging from logic and authorization mistakes to misunderstandings about the web security model, in addition to the typical vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS. Our study suggests that it remains to be a challenge for the password managers to be secure.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We found critical vulnerabilities in all three bookmarklets we studied,&#8221; the researchers report. &#8220;If a user clicks on the bookmarklet on an attackerâ€™s site, the attacker, in all three cases, learns credentials for arbitrary websites.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Our work is a wake-up call for developers of web-based password managers. The wide spectrum of discovered vulnerabilities, however, makes a single solution unlikely. Instead, we believe developing a secure web-based password manager entails a systematic, defense-in-depth approach&#8230; Future work includes creating tools to automatically identify such vulnerabilities and developing a principled, secure-by-construction password manager.&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Hacking Password Managers</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.darkreading.com/cloud/hacking-password-managers/d/d-id/1297250'>www.darkreading.com/cloud/d/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I can&rsquo;t believe we are still talking about CSRF attacks.  And for websites claiming to be <em>secured</em> for passwords themselves?  Isn&rsquo;t it a common job interview question by now (or better yet, a coding exercise) for developers in how to prevent CSRF attacks?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and how most of the common web-based password managers are all hackable.  Sure, they fixed THIS vulnerability.  Then when the next zero-day is found, it will be fixed.  And the next and the next.</p>

<p>I use a password manager.  It is not web based, does not integrate into any browser, and still requires manual intervention to open and view &ndash; with copy-n-paste only possible in some circumstances which makes the annoyance ever more livable after reading this article.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t wait until next month (August) for the paper to be released.</p>

<blockquote><p>The numerous incidents of defeating security measures prompts my cynical slogan: The more secure you make something, the less secure it becomes. Why? Because when security gets in the way, sensible, well-meaning, dedicated people develop hacks and workarounds that defeat the security. Hence the prevalence of doors propped open by bricks and wastebaskets, of passwords pasted on the fronts of monitors or hidden under the keyboard or in the drawer, of home keys hidden under the mat or above the doorframe or under fake rocks that can be purchased for this purpose.</p><p>We are being sent a mixed message: on the one hand, we are continually forced to use arbitrary security procedures. On the other hand, even the professionals ignore many of them. How is the ordinary person to know which ones matter and which don&#8217;t? The confusion has unexpected negative side-effects. I once discovered a computer system that was missing essential security patches. When I queried the computer&#8217;s user, I discovered that the continual warning against clicking on links or agreeing to requests from pop-up windows had been too effective. This user was so frightened of unwittingly agreeing to install all those nasty things from &#8220;out there&#8221; that all requests were denied, even the ones for essential security patches. On reflection, this is sensible behavior: It is very difficult to distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate. Even experts slip up, as the confessions reported occasionally in various computer digests I attest.</p><footer><strong>Don Norman</strong> <cite><a href='http://jnd.org/dn.mss/when_security_gets_in_the_way.html'>jnd.org/dn.mss/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>I recall many years ago when Microsoft proclaimed the end of password management woes with long and memorial <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512624.aspx">Pass Phrases</a>.  I personally started to really get annoyed at websites that didn&rsquo;t allow me to enter spaces or the password length was something small like 16 characters.</p>

<p>As a previous IT Administrator, having to reset so many user passwords because they locked themselves out or just plain forgot their had-to-change-ever-60-days password, I saw first hand the annoyances that most had with passwords.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until just a few years ago that the buzz around complex passwords started to shift to a &ldquo;false sense of security&rdquo; statue.  Which is very true because I have personally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">brute-force attacked</a> several passwords (in the name of education, of course).</p>

<p>Seeing how fast my X79 6-core desktop with over 5,760 GPU cores could churn through a few billion password combinations to guess a 20 character TruCrypt volume (it took only 4 hours by the way), the era of complex passwords deterring hackers is over &ndash; way way over since this hardware can easily be purchased off the shelf by anyone &ndash; and I still have room for another 6000 GPU cores if I ever upgraded.  That&rsquo;s just insane &ndash; 12,000 GPU cores in a single machine.</p>

<h2>Smart Password Hashing</h2>

<p>Now, some password managers are smart.  It wasn&rsquo;t until I read into KeePass&#8217; <a href="http://keepass.info/help/base/security.html#secdictprotect">protection against Dictionary Attacks</a> did I realize a whole &lsquo;nother way of preventing brute-force attacks.  KeePass describes their password hashing like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t really prevent these [brute-force dictionary] attacks: nothing prevents an attacker to just try all possible keys and look if the database decrypts. But what we can do (and KeePass does) is to make it harder: by adding a constant work factor to the key initialization, we can make them as hard as we want.</p><footer><strong>KeePass - Protection against Dictionary Attacks</strong> <cite><a href='http://keepass.info/help/base/security.html#secdictprotect'>keepass.info/help/base/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Please go read the rest of that quote for extreme details.  But in short, here is what they do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take your Master password and hash it.</li>
<li>Hash it another <em>N</em> number of times based on a simple pre-determined algorithm (think: PreviousHash + &ldquo;A Salt&rdquo;, PreviousHash + &ldquo;B Salt&rdquo;, etc).</li>
</ul>


<p>The trick that makes this work is that <em>N</em> should be a number of cycles that it takes your computer to compute in about 1 second.  By default, they set it to 6000 to allow for older mobile phones to be able to open the password database within about a second or two.  But this should be much higher.  Like, on a factor of 100,000 times higher.</p>

<p>For example, that same 6-core X79 CPU and 5,760 GPU core desktop I used to crack that 20-character TruCrypt could generate about 18,000,000 passwords each second.  But, when I opened KeePass and told it to calculate how many hashes it needed to perform to take at least 1 second on this machine, the answer was 23,000,000.</p>

<p>So how does rehashing 23,000,000 times work, you may ask?  Instead of my computer generating 23,000,000 passwords a second in a brute-force attack, it follows a pre-determined algorithm hashing 23,000,000 times to generate only 1 password.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let that sink in for a moment&hellip;</p>

<p>If a hackers machine is busy generating only 1 password per second, the possibility of brute force attacking a database goes from 23,000,000 per second down to just 1 per second.</p>

<p>No hacker in the world is going to continue brute-forcing that database.  Most likely they will just look for the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/31/us-usa-security-nsa-rsa-idUSBREA2U0TY20140331">NSA backdoors available in everything</a> at that point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll end with a final quote from our buddy Don from earlier.</p>

<blockquote><p>Although there is much emphasis on passwords security most break-ins occur through other means. How do thieves break into systems? They usually don&#8217;t use brute force. They phish, luring unsuspecting but helpful people to tell them their login name and password. Or they install sniffers on keyboards and record everything that was typed. The strength of passwords is irrelevant if the thief has already discovered it.</p><footer><strong>Don Norman</strong> <cite><a href='http://jnd.org/dn.mss/when_security_gets_in_the_way.html'>jnd.org/dn.mss/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<p>I have been fighting an ongoing battle with Apple&rsquo;s Wireless Keyboards and a tablet of mine, the Google Nexus 10.  While the keyboard works with all other Android and Apple devices we have (Nexus 5, Nexus 7 2013, Galaxy Nexus and Apple iPod Touch), it does not work with the Google Nexus 10.  I&rsquo;ve gone as far as to <a href="http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/66496/android-4-4-apple-bluetooth-keyboard-paired-but-not-working">asking for help on SE</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s not entirely accurate.  The story started with a used Apple Wireless Keyboard I got from eBay.  It paired and worked fine; but, some of the keys did not work.  So I bought a new one from Apple.com.</p>

<p>It paired and connected just fine; but, the brand spanking new keyboard did not work.  The Nexus 10 would not recognize an additional input device (the small &ldquo;A&rdquo; symbol in the top left corner of the screen).</p>

<p>To reiterate, this new Apple Wireless Keyboard ordered direct from Apple.com worked fine with all other Android devices (Android 4.2.2, 4.4.2, 4.4.3 and 4.4.4) and the iPod Touch 4th Gen.  It is only this Nexus 10 (Android 4.4.3 and 4.4.4) that it did not.</p>

<h2>Nexus 10 Bluetooth Stack</h2>

<p>As I blogged some time ago, not all <a href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/archives/bluetooth-expedition-the-right-stuff.html">Bluetooth devices are made equal</a>.   Devices implement the Bluetooth stack differently and sometimes miss an implementation detail.</p>

<p>I highly suspect the Nexus 10 has a flawed Bluetooth implementation, causing this incompatibility.</p>

<p>But what exactly is it incompatible with?  It worked fine with the previous Apple keyboard I got used on eBay.  It works fine with all other bluetooth keyboards I have tried.</p>

<p>Why this one Apple keyboard I got direct from apple.com?</p>

<h2>Apple Wireless Keyboard version: 2007, 2009 and 2011</h2>

<p>Atlas only after several trips to some local Apple stores did I stumble onto the issue: there are three versions of the Apple Wireless Keyboard that were sold.  I found this out by looking at about a dozen different iMacs they had, from old to new.  Surprisingly Apple&rsquo;s newest store located in NYC, in Grand Central Terminal, is the one that had the largest collection of older iMacs &ndash; ones that actually had the 2009 keyboard and even one with the 2007 keyboard.</p>

<p>They are identified by their model years.  To take a quote <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4112">directly from Apple&rsquo;s support site</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>* Apple Wireless Keyboard (2011): Features an aluminum case and uses two AA batteries. You can identify this model by the following icons on the F3 and F4 keys:</p><p><img src="http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT4112/HT4112_01----en.png" /></p><p>* Apple Wireless Keyboard (2009): Features an aluminum case and uses two AA batteries. You can identify this model by the following icons on the F3 and F4 keys:</p><p><img src="http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT4112/HT4112_02----en.png" /></p><p>* Apple Wireless Keyboard (2007): Features an aluminum case and uses three AA batteries.</p><footer><strong>Apple Support</strong> <cite><a href='http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4112'>&#8220;Apple Wireless Keyboard Compatibility&#8221;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>So, we have three keyboards available to us.  After many trials and errors, I can safely say&hellip;</p>

<h2>Get the 2009 Apple Wireless Keyboard model</h2>

<p>The used eBay model I got was a 2009 and it worked fine, dispite a few keys not working.  The Apple.com model I got was an 2011 with the latest x80 firmware &ndash; and it did not work.</p>

<p>You want to focus on the F3 and F4 keys looking like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/google-nexus-10-and-apple-wireless-keyboard-2009.jpg" title="Nexus 10 and 2009 Apple Wireless Keyboard" ></p>

<p>Again, the 2011 keyboard works fine with all other Android devices, even back to Android 4.2 on my Galaxy Nexus.  So this is clearly a fault with the Nexus 10&rsquo;s bluetooth hardware.</p>

<p>But none the less, if you want an Apple Wireless Keyboard to work with your Nexus 10, you better seek out the 2009 model.</p>

<h2>2009 Apple Wireless Keyboard Firmware</h2>

<p>And btw, the firmware version of the 2009 I found working at an Apple store has firmware version x50.  You can see it under the system&rsquo;s properties, like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/google-nexus-10-and-apple-wireless-keyboard-2009-firmware.jpg" title="Nexus 10 and 2009 Apple Wireless Keyboard Firmware" ></p>

<p>I only mention the firmware because I found a number of posts online where people upgraded their 2009 and 2011 keyboard firmwares to the latest, and lost some functionality.  I am not sure if the x50 version of the firmware is the latest.  I am only stating the exact version of the 2009 keyboard that worked flawlessly with the Nexus 10.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only two days left for comments.  At the time I left mine a month ago, there were 65,000 comments.  Now, there are 205,000.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fcc.gov/comments">The url to file your comments: fcc.gov/comments</a></p>

<p>The YouTube video hit on every point I&rsquo;ve been saying in person when talking about this, and many more.</p>

<p>One of my biggest I tell people is how the former chairman of the FCC left (forced out?), and the new one put in place by Obama last year previously ran (as in chaired and commanded) the lobbying firm for Cable and Wireless (e.g. Comcast and TimeWarner) which was directly responsible for the last attempt to create the two-tier system that the FCC blocked.  And, that sued the government to force this actual change.</p>

<p>Translation by the current FCC chairman: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t win last time. Ok, let&rsquo;s sue the FCC/government to force a rule change. When we win the lawsuit, I&rsquo;ll step down as head of this lobbyist group and become head of the FCC [so I can force this rule through].&rdquo;</p>

<p>How fracked up is that?</p>

<p>Also it sucks that NetFlix already has to pay Comcast to get service to its users.</p>

<!-- BEGIN MARKDOWN CONTENT: I can't control the formatting here, bleh -->      

<p>I have a fairly high-end home media setup in where I store my backups of nearly 500 Blu-ray quality 1080p and 720p movies and dozens of TV series on a server with over 20 TB of storage.  I&rsquo;ve archived all the blu-ray and dvds I&rsquo;ve purchased over the last 15 years into a digital format.</p>

<p>Today I want to share with you my reasons for staying with the format MKV, otherwise known as <a href="http://www.matroska.org/">Matroska</a>, over all of these years in lieu of MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV and so on.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s wrong with MP4, MOV, AVI, etc?</h2>

<p>Let me start by stating the inherit flaw of these.  I am not going to get into lossless, video quality, etc.  There are 1000s of posts on that.  There&rsquo;s also the fight that WMV won&rsquo;t play on iPads, and the Xbox refusing certain copyrighted encryptions.  No.  None of that.</p>

<p>Instead I want to focus on 1 flaw they all have in common: they are only a single layer of intermixed streams of video and audio, unable to be separated, switched off, or doubled up.</p>

<p>Think about a standard DVD or Blu-ray movie: You have multiple audio tracks including multiple commentaries that makes you want to watch the movie over and over again (I recall watching <em>Alien (1979)</em> multiple times with Sigourney Weaver&rsquo;s commentary, <em>Aliens (1986)</em> is even funnier with Bill Paxton&rsquo;s commentary).  Sometimes there are alternative endings to choose from before you start your movie.  Other times, you may need foreign subtitles for the parts in another language; or, those foreign subtitles are translated incorrectly, and you&rsquo;d rather turn them off and interrupt them yourself.</p>

<p>And there in-lies the problem with a single layer of video and audio in the above mentioned formats: whatever is selected at the time of encoding (English, Japanese subtitles, H264 video stream), is merged into a single layer &ndash; unable to be manipulated, turned off, or changed.</p>

<p>I prefer freedom of choice.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s all about the Matroska Layers</h2>

<p>At the very heart of the Matroska container (aka, file format) is its &ldquo;layer&rdquo; approach which gives it the power to encapsulate as many video, audio and subtitle tracks to your heart&rsquo;s content &ndash; all in their RAW format, unmolested by &ldquo;encoders&rdquo; that have to remix them into a single stream in the other formats.</p>

<p>Want all 5 audio commentaries for <em>Alien (1979)</em>, including the two separate Ridley Scott and Sigourney Weaver tracks?  No problem, the MKV container allows you to store as many audio tracks as you like.</p>

<p>Want the alternative cut and ending to <em>The Abyss (1989)</em> in where the aliens are actually here for a different reason (I won&rsquo;t spoil it here)?  No problem with MKVs.</p>

<p>An MKV file can do this because it essentially is just a <em>wrapper</em> around your raw binary streams (or rips) of H264 video, AAC or FLAC audio, and the subtitle text file(s).  DVDs and Blu-rays store these streams separately &ndash; it is how you can switch audio tracks or alternative endings.  It is only natural that you take these raw streams from these disks, and wrap them in a container of sorts (MKV) to have them all at your fingertips to switch video, audio and languages with a click of the button.</p>

<p>Welcome to Matroska.</p>

<h2>Example: Multiple Camera Angles (multiple video streams)</h2>

<p>One of my favorite DVDs is my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peter-Gabriel-Growing-Up-Live/dp/B0000DZ3H4?tag=eduncan911-20"><em>Peter Gabriel&rsquo;s &ndash; Growing Up Live (2003)</em></a>, a live recording in Milan of his <em>Growing Up Tour</em> in 2003.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this DVD (I really wish they would release a blu-ray) is that it has interactive camera angles during multiple titles.  You are able to &ldquo;switch videos streams&rdquo; to a different camera angles.  Pretty cool.</p>

<p>With Matroska, I retained these video angles within the single MKV file I created of the DVD when I ripped it.  Given though, I didn&rsquo;t copy the &ldquo;cue markers&rdquo; overlay from the original DVD viewing.  You kind of have to know when you can change angles, and you can select a different video stream while playing.</p>

<h2>Subtitles</h2>

<p>This one is especially important to my family.  With a spouse of a different nationality, English sub-titles are a near must.</p>

<p>The other formats have to &ldquo;burn-in&rdquo; sub-titles on-top of the video, removing the option to turn it off.  Yes, many decoders allow you to add an .srt file alongside the MP4 and it will overlay the subtitles (if you get the right one, and if it is in sync with its time codes).</p>

<p>Again, thanks to Matroska&rsquo;s layers, this is only a matter of adding (or removing, or reording) the subtitle tracks that are part of the MKV layers.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t like the Dutch sub-titles as default?  Reorder them, or remove them.</p>

<h2>MKV is open source and well documented</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s right.  No copyright or patents to infringe on.  The perhaps most importantly, the container format is very well documented allowing for anyone to create a set of tools themselves.</p>

<p>It is a real shame that the big players ignore this format, and it is up to us end-users to hack our devices to play them.</p>

<h2>Besides, I can always convert to any format later</h2>

<p>Having all the video and audio streams alongside the closed caption allows me to convert my backups of MKVs into any format I like in the future.</p>

<p>Once such tool is <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>, which is a great free and open source app for converting MKVs into any format.  An example is is the Android Tablet profile they have which takes a 15 GB movie and compresses it down to a 1.8 GB file (for the kiddo&rsquo;s tablet).</p>

<h2>A callout to Microsoft, Apple and Google</h2>

<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t MKV gone mainstream?  Why hasn&rsquo;t one of these companies openly embraced this superior format?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: copyright and encryption.  The Matroska format does not support either with its free and open container formats; and therefore, no media partner (MPAA) will ever support a company that openly embraces a format that splays their precious video and audio for all to see and use.</p>

<h2>Handle it myself</h2>

<p>So that leaves me, a lone person, burdened to create my own Matroska MKV containers myself.  More cumbersome is the annoyance of getting the MKVs to play on multiple devices in different media centers and tables.</p>

<p>It seems every few years I have to <em>re-evaluate</em> my media devices and setup to ensure everything is compatible.  Seems to come around with each new Windows release, since the hunt for decoders and setup starts all over.</p>

<p>Next time, it&rsquo;s Linux once and for all.</p>

<!-- BEGIN MARKDOWN CONTENT: I can't control the formatting here, bleh -->      

<p>All too often I keep Googling this procedure to sign into SSH terminals with certificate keys since I&rsquo;ve been switching to Linux for development.  Like my previous post on how to <a href="/blog/archives/create-a-bootable-usb-drive-with-windows.html">Create a Bootable USB Drive with Windows</a>, I felt it was time to write my own step-by-step guide for my future reference.</p>

<p>First, let me explain why I do this.</p>

<h2>Why use SSH keys to login?</h2>

<p>Everyone knows you log into Windows and Linux machines with a username and password.  The obvious issue is, what happens when someone gets your username and password?  Yep, they can now login.</p>

<p>What if there was a way to <em>sign</em> your specific machine, say your desktop, to only allow connections from it?  Then, combine that machine signature with yet another password (called a passphrase) for an impromptu two-factor authentication to login?  (Factor 1, the certificate key; Factor 2, your passphrase)</p>

<p>That is my take on why I use SSH keys to sign into Linux machines.  You not only need my password; but, you also need my certificate.</p>

<h3>Other Reasons to use SSH keys for logins</h3>

<p>There are other reasons to use SSH keys for logins.  I also use them for script automation across multiple Linux machines, in which the script needs to log into the remote machine to perform commands.  The easiest way to do that is to not use a passphrase, then the user account that the script runs under will have the ssh keys added allowing them to remotely signin.  Less secure, but also less of a headache to setup.  You can still use a passphrase in your scripts, and even encrypt it so it isn&rsquo;t in the clear text.  That is beyond this post though.</p>

<p>Ok, enough with reasoning &ndash; let&rsquo;s setup PuTTY now.</p>

<h2>First, the PuTTY Quirks</h2>

<p>PuTTY is a great app for Windows.  It&rsquo;s GUI though is a little odd and takes some getting used to.  Specifically, it is a bit quirky around the Sessions, aka Profiles that allows you to save settings for quick connections in the future (just select it, click Open and that&rsquo;s it).  Unless you hit Load, Save and Delete in the right sequence, things won&rsquo;t be loaded, saved or deleted.</p>

<p>Because of this, I recommend setting up your Session profile first before we get started with SSH keys.  Nothing worse than going through all the steps to create a Session profile, and missing one step, having it all wiped out to start over.</p>

<h2>Create and Save a PuTTY Session profile</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the steps I take to create a Session profile.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open PuTTY and you should be in the Session category on the left.</li>
<li>For the <code>Host Name</code>, enter the DNS or IP address.  E.g. mylinuxvm.cloudapp.net</li>
<li>Make sure <code>Port 22</code> and <code>SSH</code> options are set (usually the default).</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/1-putty-create-session.png" title="Create Session Profile in PuTTY" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Set a default <code>Username</code> to login with by clicking the category <code>Connection</code> then <code>Data</code>.  Enter your username in the <code>Auto-login username</code> text box.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/2-putty-create-session.png" title="Auto-Login Username in PuTTY Session" ></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Finally, to save your Session profile, click back on the Session category on the left.  Then under the <code>Saved Sessions</code> textbox, enter a name for this session. I like to call my sessions the name of my VMs, e.g. mylinuxvm.cloudapp.net.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, press the Save button.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/3-putty-create-session.png" title="Save Session Profile in PuTTY" ></p>

<p>You have now created your first Session profile in PuTTY.  It&rsquo;s usually during this Save process that I may inadvertently click on one of the existing Saved Sessions, in which your profile is now completed wiped out and you have to start all over.</p>

<p>It is now time to generate your Public and Private key pair that you will need to setup on the remote Linux box.</p>

<h2>Generate a PuTTY Public/Private Key Pair</h2>

<p>The next step is to generate the key pair that you&rsquo;ll configure your shell to use.  We do this with PuTTY&rsquo;s included <code>PUTTYGEN.EXE</code> file in the directory of where you installed/unzipped PuTTY to.</p>

<p>Running <code>PUTTYGEN.EXE</code> opens a new window.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/4-generate-ssh-keys-in-putty.png" title="&#34;Generate SSH Keys in PuTTY&#34;" alt="&#34;Generate SSH Keys in PuTTY&#34;"></p>

<p>You will need to <code>Generate</code> a new public/private key pair and save both the public key and private key separately to continue.  Start by clicking the <code>Generate</code> button, and move your mouse around to generate a random key.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/5-generate-ssh-keys-in-putty.png" title="&#34;Generate SSH Keys in PuTTY&#34;" alt="&#34;Generate SSH Keys in PuTTY&#34;"></p>

<p>Once the key pair has been generated, you have a few options.  It is highly recommend to change the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the <code>Key comment</code> to be your email address, or machine name.</li>
<li>Set a passphrase, you will use this as your password when connecting each time.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, it is time to save the Public key file and Private key file.  Click the buttons and save each file in a safe place.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/6-generate-ssh-keys-in-putty.png" title="&#34;Generate SSH Keys in PuTTY&#34;" alt="&#34;Generate SSH Keys in PuTTY&#34;"></p>

<p>CAUTION: If you are going to disable password logins for your box, and only allow SSH key logins, you will want to keep the private key in a very safe, and backed up, place as if you loose it you will loose access to the machine.</p>

<h2>Take the Public key, and assign it to your Linux box</h2>

<p>Now it is time to copy the contents of the Public key file and place it on the remote server.</p>

<p>Load up PuTTY again and click on your Saved Session, then click Open.  Enter your normal username&rsquo;s password when you setup the Linux box when prompted &ndash; do not enter your Passphrase just yet.  If prompted for the security warning, click Yes as it is your first connection to the server.</p>

<p>You are going to create an <code>authorized_keys2</code> file in your shell, and copy your public key text directly into it.</p>

<p>For this, I am going to assume you already have an ~/.ssh/ directory.  If not, just create it:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir ~/.ssh
</span><span class='line'>chmod 700 ~/.ssh</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, create the file:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pico ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You must now paste the entire Public key, all on one line, here within the editor.  Again, make sure it is all on one line.  It should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/7-copy-public-ssh-key-to-shell.png" title="&#34;Linux SSH Public Key Setup for PuTTY&#34;" alt="&#34;Linux SSH Public Key Setup for PuTTY&#34;"></p>

<p>In Pico (now nano), press <code>CTRL-X</code> to exit.  It will ask you to save, press <code>Y</code> and you are done.</p>

<p>It is recommended to set the permissions read/write for your user only.  To do this, execute the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Type <code>exit</code> or close your PuTTY, you are done with the shell.</p>

<h2>Set the Private Key in your PuTTY Session Profile</h2>

<p>Remember that Session profile we first created at the beginning?  Now it is time to set it up to use your new public/private key.</p>

<p>Open PuTTY yet again and when prompted for which Saved session, we have to be a little careful with the quirkiness.  You will want to <code>Load</code> the Saved session first, before we can modify it.</p>

<p>Select your Saved Session you previously created, and click the <code>Load</code> button.</p>

<p>Then on the left, click the <code>Connection -&gt; SSH -&gt; Auth</code> category.</p>

<p>Click the Browse button and select the previously saved <code>Private key</code> this time.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/9-set-private-key-in-PuTTY-for-ssh-login.png" title="&#34;Set SSH Private Key in PuTTY for SSH Key-Based Login&#34;" alt="&#34;Set SSH Private Key in PuTTY for SSH Key-Based Login&#34;"></p>

<p>Almost done, you need to go back and <code>Save</code> your Session profile again.  Do this by clicking the Session category on the left again.</p>

<p>Simply press <code>Save</code> here.  Do nothing else. Do not click on your previous Saved Session, as this will erase what you just changed.  Do not reload it, as that will erase it again.  Yep, PuTTY quirkiness.  Just click <code>Save</code> and you are done.</p>

<h2>Completed.  Now, connect.</h2>

<p>Now it is time to test it.  Click on your Saved Session, and click Open.  You should be created with something similar to this:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/key-based-ssh-logins-with-putty/10-logging-in-with-putty-ssh-key.png" title="&#34;Logging in with PuTTY SSH Key-Base Authentication&#34;" alt="&#34;Logging in with PuTTY SSH Key-Base Authentication&#34;"></p>

<p>Enter your passphrase you setup at the beginning of this guide, and that should be it.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>While it is not recommended, you could skip the passphrase creation and leave it blank.  This can give you a kind of auto-login when connecting.  But do note, anyone who gets your private key file can log into that shell with no password as well.</p>

<p>You are also able to setup multiple public keys for a single shell account by adding additional lines to that <code>authorized_keys2</code> file &ndash; one per line.  This can help segment control to multiple parties logging into the same machine (say a dev ops team that deploys &ndash; each member gets their own public/private key pair to use).  That way, you can reject a login at a later time by simply removing the line from the <code>authorized_keys2</code> file.</p>

<!-- BEGIN MARKDOWN CONTENT: I can't control the formatting here, bleh -->      

<p><a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/X-Series-Tablet-ThinkPad-Laptops/Helix-End-Insert-keys-swapped/m-p/1136273/highlight/true#M21181">Lenovo Helix End/Insert Keys Swapped</a></p>

<p>I recently switched from the Dell-exclusive club of laptops over the past 15 years to a ThinkPad.  Specifically, the Lenovo ThinkPad Helix.  It was a unit I have been waiting years for to check all the right boxes.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been privy to the IBM/Lenovo keyboard wars.  I have always heard great things about the IBM ThinkPad keyboard.  Well, it seems this Lenovo Helix came with the newer style of only one row of Function keys + hardware-specific keys (volume, brightness, etc).  Fine by me as I figured out how to lock in the Function-mode-always (a BIOS option).</p>

<p>But now I had a serious problem when coding/writing long documents&hellip;</p>

<h2>The End/Insert Key was Swapped</h2>

<p>Why in the hell would the End/Insert key swap functions when I lock in the Function-key mode of the F1-F12 keys?</p>

<p>This was almost a deal breaker.  Only after crawling the Lenovo forums (a great place to find hacks for Lenovo) did I stumble onto a Lenovo ThinkPad keyboard hack to <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/X-Series-Tablet-ThinkPad-Laptops/Helix-End-Insert-keys-swapped/m-p/1136273/highlight/true#M21181">reverse the key functions</a>.  It actually remaps the Windows keyboard layout in the registry, an age-old trick I forgot about over a decade ago!</p>

<h2>Swapping the End/Insert key functions</h2>

<p>Instead of supplying a download of a .reg file, which I am not even sure that GitHub supports, I&rsquo;ll explain the instructions on how to create your own .reg file.</p>

<ul>
<li>Right-click on your desktop, select <code>New -&gt; Text Document</code></li>
<li>Copy and Paste the following into this document, letter by letter.</li>
</ul>


<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>lenovo-helix-end-insert-key-swap.reg</span><a href='https://gist.github.com/eduncan911/f27808d2bb30982b4da5'>link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
</span><span class='line'>&quot;Scancode Map&quot;=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,03,00,00,00,52,e0,4f,e0,4f,e0,52,e0,00,00,00,00
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<ul>
<li>Save the file as <code>lenovo-helix-end-insert-key-swap.reg</code></li>
<li>Double-click it to <code>merge</code> it into your registry.  You will need to be logged in as an Administrator.</li>
<li>Reboot and you&rsquo;re done.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, the function of the End/Insert will be swapped.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://blog.lenovo.com/products/why-you-should-give-in-to-the-new-thinkpad-keyboard">devoted fans of the previous Thinkpad keyboard: you may want to take your anger here</a>.</p>
