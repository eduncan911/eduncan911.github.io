<P>After <A href="http://webbalert.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://webbalert.com/">Morgan Webb</A> pitched me over to the <A href="http://blackbird.wikia.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://blackbird.wikia.com">Blackbird&#8217;s Wikia&#8217;s</A> site about a month ago, I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye out for the specs.&nbsp; Now that I see HP has launched a site about the <A href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/">HP Blackbird 002</A> (love the bassy intro), I am able to compare the HP monster to what I consider it&#8217;s #1 rival, the <A href="http://www.dell.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell XPS 700 series gaming desktops</A>.&nbsp; Morgan and I have very similar views on many fronts, such as the <A href="/archive/2007/01/27/if-you-watch-ads-you-should-get-free-stuff.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="/archive/2007/01/27/if-you-watch-ads-you-should-get-free-stuff.aspx">advertising in PC games</A>, so we dive into latest from HP.</P>


<P>First off, I can not do a direct hardware-to-hardware comparison.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t work for Tom&#8217;s Hardware nor have I received a version of these PCs to review (if Dell/HP is reading this, hollar!).&nbsp; And I simply can&#8217;t afford to buy both for a personal review.&nbsp; But I do consider myself an ubber elite PC enthusiast since the mid 80s (hey, I was 11 then) hacking the teacher&#8217;s Apple for better grades.&nbsp; I will try to apply my knowledge to the posted information about each system to more accurately help you make your decision with minimal jargon-talk.</P>


<P><STRONG>A little background info</STRONG> <BR>HP was not the first to the &#8220;buy our name-brand performance-PC that you can mod&#8221; market.&nbsp; You could be technical and go way back to IBM I owned that was an 4mhz 8086 and boasted as &#8220;user upgradable&#8221; by allowing for memory chips to be purchased to upgrade it from 512kb to 640kb of total ram.&nbsp; But the dual 5.25&#8221; floppy-sized 10 MB HDD was a bit more complicated though. Tip: Use the DOS <A href="http://thestarman.pcministry.com/asm/debug/debug.htm" target=_blank mce_href="http://thestarman.pcministry.com/asm/debug/debug.htm">debug</A> tool as it gave me another 1.20 MB of space by removing the extra space reserved for &#8220;bad sector marking&#8221;.&nbsp; Woot!&nbsp; Ok, too much jargon. </P>


<P>By my recollection, Dell was the first to design, build, and release a fully customizable desktop with gamers and hardcore enthusiasts in mind allowing end-users to modify and upgrade it on their own, if only by their own kits.&nbsp; Heck, they even have <A href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/07/10/17626.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/07/10/17626.aspx">special motherboard upgrade instructional videos</A> and a <A href="http://www.xpsupgradeprogramdell.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.xpsupgradeprogramdell.com">dedicated website</A> for just the upgrade.&nbsp; Obviously, this Dell PC I&#8217;m talking about is called the XPS 700 we are looking into here.</P>


<P>What I really like about Dell as a company is that their engineers have released videos and podcasts about this product (and most other products) right at the same time that Dell released their new <A href="/archive/2006/07/09/Dell-gets-down-One2One-with-you.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="/archive/2006/07/09/Dell-gets-down-One2One-with-you.aspx">Direct-2-Dell weblog and videoblog</A> back in March 2007.&nbsp; The Direct2Dell site allows engineers to post thoughts, product descriptions, videos, and even customer service responses for just about anything Dell - and receive feedback directly from you on the subject matter.&nbsp; This is a first for an industry that seems to hide behind technical support to filter feedback to customer service and engineers, if it even gets that far. </P>


<P>Anyhoot, no I am not sponsored by Dell.&nbsp; Nor am I affiliated in any way with Dell, for the most part.&nbsp; My previous employer and I built the Direct2Dell blog site, so I am a little partial to Dell in that regard as I haven&#8217;t seen any similar manufacturers doing the same.&nbsp; That, and I thought it was pretty freakin&#8217; cool of them.</P>


<P><STRONG>The Dell XPS 700</STRONG> <BR>Getting back to the topic at hand, the Dell XPS 700 series comes in two flavors: The XPS 700 and XPS 700H2O (water cooled).&nbsp; The 720 series now available includes support for quad-core processors as noted on <A href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2058399,00.asp" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2058399,00.asp">ExtremeTech</A> and is also available as a &#8220;Motherboard Upgrade&#8221; kit for earlier 700 series consumers.&nbsp; Yes, I&#8217;m plugging another larger community site I did wanting the recognition for our new web design and consulting company, <A href="http://colorburn.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://colorburn.com/">Colorburn</A>, specializing in CommunityServer large communities.&nbsp; Ok, no more plugs - I promise.</P>


<P>The XPS 700 series is pretty sleek.&nbsp; Instead of trying to define or describe this unit, I believe Dell&#8217;s videoblog does the best job without me having to interpret their information <A href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/84.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/84.aspx">here</A> and <A href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/79.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/79.aspx">here</A> (the first video really shows it&#8217;s size!), amongst the dozens of other posts from their <A href="http://direct2dell.com/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=XPS" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=XPS">engineers here</A>, that yes you can provide direct feedback to.&nbsp; It&#8217;s quite a beast, to say the least.</P>


<P>The one thing that struck me about the Dell XPS was how they actually encourage users to overclock, upgrade, and interchange parts.&nbsp; As time went on, I see the parts are mostly sold in &#8220;Upgrade Kits&#8221; from Dell such as newer proprietary motherboard and CPU combos.&nbsp; But still you can go throw in any newer PCIe 16x video card and CPU, and have a Core2 Duo system running&nbsp;over 1400mhz bus in no time.&nbsp; </P>


<P><STRONG>HP Blackbird 002</STRONG> <BR>No, I don&#8217;t consider the Blackbird with it&#8217;s Core 2 Extreme Duo Quad Core an <A href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/588016/sr_71_blackbird/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/588016/sr_71_blackbird/">SR-71 Blackbird</A> (ah yes, a nice <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088979/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088979/">D.A.R.Y.L.</A> flashback).&nbsp; It really is a serious machine.&nbsp; But in the world of videoblogging, I find myself scanning for text to read more and viewing a photo gallery.&nbsp; Eh, Dell has spoiled me.</P>


<P>Reading about the motherboard and their &#8221;<A href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/history/" target=_blank mce_href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/history/">Voodoo process of elimination</A>&#8221;, it seems they are going to be selling a rig with a custom mobo that&#8217;s not interchangeable - just like the Dell.&nbsp; You can supply as many PCI and PCIe slots as you want to.&nbsp; These days, most things are built onto the motherboards now which you just end up swapping out every few years any ways.&nbsp; But given both the HP and Dell&#8217;s mobos seem to be proprietary, maybe having these extra slots is a good thing so you can install the next-generation sound card when it&#8217;s invented (since <A href="http://www.creative.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.creative.com/">Creative&#8217;s</A> last effort, the X-Fi, didn&#8217;t take off as they hoped it would).</P>


<P>I was impressed with the Blackbird with its built-in RAID5 for storage.&nbsp; Any storage junkie knows that RAID5 provides more throughput then a single HDD, and a RAID1 setup is dirt-slow.&nbsp; Dell&#8217;s XPS only comes in RAID1 or RAID0 flavors (RAID0 being the fastest, yes, but not redundant).&nbsp; My only issue is there is no cache memory for the raid system (that I can see listed).&nbsp; As with the cache on CPUs, this makes all the difference in RAID setups and it&#8217;s why I would stick to my Areca PCIe setup for a RAID solution.</P>


<P>Only time will tell (when released) if the Blackbird is truly an upgradable piece.&nbsp; If they offer &#8220;Motherboard Kits&#8221; such as the ones from Dell to keep their end-users happy by upgrading to the latest mobo/cpu combinations, then it really will give Dell a run for their money (serious money that is).</P>


<P><STRONG>Taking the plunge</STRONG> <BR>Both Dell and HP have developed amazing systems that can be bumped to some pretty high FSB and memory speeds with very little work.&nbsp; But what both will require instead is a decent credit score to be able to afford it.&nbsp; Yes that&#8217;s right folks, these &#8220;user serviceable&#8221; PCs are not cheap.&nbsp; But on the flip side, they aren&#8217;t overly expensive either such as the recent <A href="http://www.alienware.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.alienware.com">AlienWare</A> units these days.&nbsp; Now I love AlienWare so don&#8217;t flame me, but over the recent years they have moved to more of a &#8220;pay for our designer brand (cases)&#8221; instead of worrying about end-user affordability of super high-end PCs like they were in the past.&nbsp; My preferred HP Blackbird setup looks to be around $6500, while the matching Dell is $6100.&nbsp; But when pricing a comparable AlienWare, it came to $7100 - which is amazing if you consider that <A href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1941376,00.asp" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1941376,00.asp">AlienWare is now owned by Dell</A>.&nbsp; </P>


<P>Maybe it&#8217;s similar to a Cadillac Escalade vs a Chevy Tahoe: one&#8217;s decked out a lot more when compared to Dell&#8217;s base desktops.&nbsp; But Dell now has the XPS 700 systems that directly competes with AlienWare&#8217;s recent offerings.&nbsp; Maybe the XPS 700s are using the same base perhaps?&nbsp; But I don&#8217;t see AlienWare boasting &#8220;Motherboard Upgrade&#8221; kits, so I&#8217;d have to say no to that theory and sway more towards the XPS systems that allows you to upgrade.</P>


<P><STRONG>Water cooling</STRONG> <BR>I&#8217;m not going into the whole liquid-cooling debate and trying to sell you on it, but just wanted to note a few advantages.&nbsp; Water is one of the best heat conductors, exchanging heat quite quickly and efficiently.&nbsp; With this idea in mind, the PC overclocking world developed into an industry requiring a good heat exchanger while keeping the volume down on the fans.&nbsp; Any chemistry expert can reaffirm you that by blasting water onto a water block made of copper or silver allows the heat to transfer to the water quite efficiently and away from the water block.&nbsp; Then all you have to do is move the water to a radiator to remove the heat.</P>


<P><A href="http://www.ocforums.com/showthread.php?p=3243098" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.ocforums.com/showthread.php?p=3243098">In my rig</A> which was my first H2O experiment (I know, late to the party), it turned out to be quite amazing.&nbsp; It&#8217;s near-silent operation at 1200mhz FSB with my theory of &#8220;bigger is better&#8221; is achieved by simply using an extremely large and oversized radiator (oversized as it&#8217;s just for the CPU and FSB), with three large (and quiet) fans spinning at the slowest speed possible (@ 4.4v).&nbsp; Most watercooling gurus use a small radiator just the size of a single fan, which usually requires the fan to run at full 12v speed.&nbsp; That&#8217;s just too loud for me.</P>


<P>I mention watercooling as Dell&#8217;s XPS 700 series actually has it as an option, where the HP Blackbird comes with a sealed unit from the get-go.&nbsp; HP is actually claiming they are the &#8221;<A href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/thermals/" target=_blank mce_href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/thermals/">first performance-PC manufacturer to effectively implement liquid-cooling</A>&#8221;.&nbsp; I find this hard to swallow looking at AlienWare (considered a manufacturer as of 2005 when they got away from off-the-shelve mobos), and even Dell earlier this year with their XPS 700H2O series.&nbsp; Now I will give HP mucho props for making it sealed and never needing service.&nbsp; That is what they should have focused on in their claims.&nbsp; </P>


<P>But given my research in the past, no &#8220;H2O kit&#8221; can hold a candle (heat - phun intended) to your own custom made setup.&nbsp; The effort required though, is a whole other story.&nbsp; Refer to <A href="http://www.ocforums.com/" mce_href="http://www.ocforums.com">www.ocforums.com</A> if you want to take that path of the dark side (by far the best site for information on H2O I found years ago).</P>


<P><STRONG>Conclusion <BR></STRONG>The Dell XPS with it&#8217;s Core 2 Extreme QX68xx 8MB overclocked quad core available is close to the same cost as the HP Blackbird when it comes down to it with dual nVidia 8800 SLIs and LCD.</P>


<P>But I have to lean towards Dell with their <A href="http://direct2dell.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/">Direct2Dell</A> videoblog and engineer&#8217;s playground of fishing for feedback to their products, where I feel I can be <EM>influential</EM>.&nbsp; Where is HP&#8217;s Direct2HP website so I can provide my comments to their engineers?&nbsp; Is that what the <A title=http://blackbird.wikia.com href="http://blackbird.wikia.com/" mce_href="http://blackbird.wikia.com">blackbird.wikia.com</A> website is for?&nbsp; This website doesn&#8217;t seem to be geared towards feedback for HP&#8217;s newest player to the market and looks more like an open blog.</P>


<P>I really want to get away from what Ms. Webb describes as &#8220;spending hours and hours with the same old issues&#8221; by building, maintaining, and upgrading my own hardware.&nbsp; I have to look at the cost I would spend to get a comparable PC from HP/Dell that I could build one for.&nbsp; So it comes down to, is your time worth a few grand to spend on saving you the time of building these PCs and upgrading?&nbsp; I can argue both sides of the equation, but only you can answer it for yourself.&nbsp; Hardcore builders will not be swayed by the Blackbird, nor Dell, and will continue to build for less.&nbsp; Much less.</P>


<P>But then again looking back at the time and effort it took to get my rig up to snuff, I really could have used those several months for something else to make up the cost for one of these XPS 700s or Blackbirds.&nbsp; Humm, I do need a new PC soon&#8230;</P>
