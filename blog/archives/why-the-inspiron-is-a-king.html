<p>I step away from the system, hands nearly numb, being reminded again since 4 years why PCs will always out perform the latest consoles such as the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. As I finish a two hour session of Battlefield 2 with my old buddies from <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.tcunit.com/" href="http://www.tcunit.com/">TCU</a>, I can&#8217;t help but to be amazed at the new found graphics tonight I have not seen before because my previous systems could not handle HDTV and full graphics.</p>


<h6 align="center"><a target="_blank" mce_href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590.png" href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590.png"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Battlefield2, 1920x1200x32, Ultra-High Hack, ~89 FPS " width="644" height="404" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590_thumb.png" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590_thumb.png"></a> </h6>


<p align="center"><b>Battlefield2, 1920x1200x32, Ultra-High Hack, ~89 FPS</b> </p>




<p>Stepping back, a bit dumb-founded, I question my sanity in the PC I just built tonight. I justify it quickly when I consider the tiny investment it took to bring this desktop to be the game-crushing machine it is now.&nbsp; Only this time it is not my 4.2 Ghz 1200mhz FSB desktop - it&#8217;s my $900 Dell Inspiron E1705 work laptop that I spent $240 upgrading. 
</p>


<p>I have been a long-time advocate for Dell machines back from my IT Administrator days in Atlanta at CASE Masters and iDealmusic.&nbsp; Dell laptops in particular have had an interesting reign.&nbsp; Back in 1998, <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.pcmag.com" href="http://www.pcmag.com">PC Magazine</a> started to issue the &#8220;Drop Test&#8221; against the leading laptops.&nbsp; Being dropped from six feet, all laptops failed to boot up except one - the Dell Latitude series which was a business-class unit.&nbsp; It was my first laptop I bought, and still have it.&nbsp; I was using it all the way up to 2005, lastly for automotive tuning. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Dell Inspiron E1705/9400 Exploded View " width="470" height="585" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/exploded_view.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/exploded_view.jpg"> <br><b>Dell Inspiron E1705/9400 Exploded View</b> (source: support.dell.com) </p>




<p>This story starts with the Dell Inspiron E1705 or also known as the 9400.&nbsp; Dell has done something great here, a laptop that is user-serviceable and user-upgradable.&nbsp; Yes it is a discontinued laptop, but if I only have know when I had it back at Telligent there would have been some serious modding going on.&nbsp; Tonight, I ventured into wild with a few components and upgrades not normally available.&nbsp; Each one has its own story to tell. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="E1705, 4 GB SDRAM, nVidia FX2500 7900GTX 512MB, Arctic Silver 5 " width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0004.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0004.jpg"> <br><b>E1705, 4 GB SDRAM, nVidia FX2500 7900GTX 512MB, Arctic Silver 5</b> </p>


<h3>4 GB SDRAM PC2-5400 667mhz</h3>


<p>The first thing many will cry fowl on here is, &#8220;The Inspiron E1705/9400 does not support 4GB of ram.&#8221;&nbsp; This is untrue.&nbsp; While yes the bios only sees 3.25 GB available, so does the M17xx XPS systems and many desktop motherboards.&nbsp; There are lots of theories to this, but the truth is that your peripherals reserve that memory space and Windows allows them to over 3 GB - even if they never will use it.&nbsp; Basically, they are powered but never used.&nbsp; Using PAE causes some mobo/bios combinations to free up that address block to 4 GB, allowing for up 4.5 GB to be used.&nbsp; But the sad fact is there isn&#8217;t much you can do right now when it&#8217;s restricted at the hardware level.&nbsp; </p>




<p>Me?&nbsp; I figured it was a good $61 investment for my next laptop to have 4 GB as well.&nbsp; :) 
</p>


<h3>nVidia quadro FX2500m 512MB, 7900GTX GPU, PCI-E CAD and Gaming Card</h3>


<p>Another thing many will deny is the ability to stick an XPS or M90 &#8220;high-end&#8221; design cad and/or gaming card into the &#8216;low-end&#8221; Inspiron business-class line.&nbsp; As you can see below, this is not the case either and the installation is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; The M90 designer-cad graphics card is the nVidia FX2500m quadro, which is a modified version of the 7900 GTX 512 MB (from my research).&nbsp; 
</p>


<p>The forum gurus are spending $350 to $500 on this particular card.&nbsp; I snagged mine from eBay for $160.&nbsp; The theory here was if it truly performs as well as the desktop version, then I can finally, after 4 years of planning, downgrade my PC to our Vista MCE machine in the main room and move to the laptop full-time (mobile again!).&nbsp; That is precisely what the PC was built for, less the water-cooling rig which actually is built to handle the heat demands for the next 5 to 7 years of CPUs.&nbsp; So bring &#8216;em on! 
</p>


<h3>Dell 150w PA15 Power Adapter</h3>


<p>Most Dells these days come with an 90w.&nbsp; While this one sufficed for the first few hours of gaming, I did notice the unit getting much hotter than normal.&nbsp; Others amongst the net have mentioned that a 130w or 150w is needed because the 90w will burn out with these upgrades.&nbsp; So I ordered an original Dell PA15 new in box from eBay for $20.&nbsp; I needed a 2nd adapter anyhow.&nbsp; But be warned - they don&#8217;t call these things a &#8220;brick&#8221; for no reason.&nbsp; This thing is literally the size of a brick! 
</p>


<h3>Overclocking</h3>


<p>I do not think I will be overclocking, but yes it is true.&nbsp; People are dramatically <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.notebookforums.com/forum153.html" href="http://www.notebookforums.com/forum153.html">overclocking their Dell</a> laptops.&nbsp; At this time the E1705&#8217;s CPU, bus, and memory can not be overclocked (except the memory timings).&nbsp; But the GPU (graphics processor unit) can be if it is the nVidia series, and quite extensively too! 
</p>


<h3>Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Paste</h3>


<p>I only mention this because the other gurus on the forums have been putting this into their systems for the CPU upgrades.&nbsp; I have used AS5 for many years now, and I swear by it.&nbsp; My 4.2 Ghz desktop machine idles @ 28C and peaks at 37C with both cores maxed.&nbsp; That is just amazing (plus the water cooling). 
</p>


<p>So in this venture I decided to break out the old tube from the freezer and slap a dab on the CPU.&nbsp; The result was more than I expected with only 15 minutes of work, and well worth it.&nbsp; So let us begin the photo slide show with commen[dy]tary. 
</p>


<p>I was browsing one day and wanted a temperature reader for my laptop as I was noticing the fans kicking on high and the keyboard running quite hot at times.&nbsp; I stumbled upon <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.notebookforums.com/" href="http://www.notebookforums.com/">Notebook Forums</a> and was amazed at the level of upgrades people have done to their laptops from all brands.&nbsp; It seems the manufacturers have finally gave up and allowed end-users the ability to upgrade their machines.&nbsp; You can read up on your brand there.

<p><b><font size="4">Preface</font></b></p>




<p>This post is not meant to be a complete guide to installing the hardware.&nbsp; Instead it is more of a visual verification cue of some modifications (read cutting) that you must do.&nbsp; Check out Dell&#8217;s support page and view/download the <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/en/manuals?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs" href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/en/manuals?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">service manual</a> as it has very detailed, step-by-step instructions to opening and servicing your laptop. </p>




<p><b><font size="4">So now let us break this thing open&#8230;</font></b></p>




<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Hinge Cover Removed " width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0005.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0005.jpg"> <br><b>Hinge Cover Removed</b> </p>




<p>First thing the service manual says is to remove the hinge cover as shown above.&nbsp; It was a bit nerve racking to pry that hard on a piece of plastic, and having it pop - sounding like I was breaking each and every tab.&nbsp; Being the first step in the entire process, I did have a reservation.&nbsp; But pushed on, prying harder, knowing it would come off cause the manual said so.&nbsp; 
</p>


<p>This is the most difficulty step.&nbsp; Get past the cracking, creaking, and popping sounds and you are home free. 
</p>


<p>Tip: If you do not have a plastic scribe, you can use a small/tiny flat-head screwdriver but do not pry up as the manual says because this will scratch the white plastic.&nbsp; Instead, use a twisting motion to pop the panel up and loose at the location of the red arrow.&nbsp; Then slowly work your way around the corner, twisting and popping the rest loose.&nbsp; Once you can get your finger under it, pull up and don&#8217;t be scared. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Keyboard Removed, ATI visible " width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0007.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0007.jpg"> <br><b>Keyboard Removed, ATI visible</b> </p>




<p>Next comes the keyboard.&nbsp; Nothing special here.&nbsp; I just wanted to show you the first glimpse of the ATI X1400 video card to be removed. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Dell 1500 802.11n WiFi card and Antenna Leads " width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0008.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0008.jpg"> <br><b>Dell 1500 802.11n WiFi card and Antenna Leads</b> </p>




<p>Skipping ahead, along the way of removing the LCD panel it says to disconnect the wireless antenna of your wireless card.&nbsp; Here you can see the antenna leads connected to the Dell 1500 802.11n card via the red arrows.&nbsp; There is some questions on the web to even having to do this step if you do not have a wifi card.&nbsp; The answer is yes, they are just connected to dummy terminals. 
</p>


<p>And yes, if you put things back together and have no signal on your wifi card - you forgot to connect these! 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="LCD Panel Removed " width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0009.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0009.jpg"> <br><b>LCD Panel Removed</b> </p>




<p>With the LCD removed, you&#8217;ve passed the point of no return (or now you are fully committed rather).&nbsp; 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Magnetized Screwdriver Helps " width="644" height="430" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0013.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0013.jpg"> <br><b>Magnetized Screwdriver Helps</b> </p>




<p>This shows a little trick I have been using since I was a younglin&#8217;.&nbsp; I have a special set of tools that are magnetized, allowing me to remove (as shown) and install screws in very difficult places.&nbsp; Tools like this screwdriver pulls the screw right out, not having to flip over the system and let them drop and bounce. 
</p>


<p>It is very easy to magnetize your existing screwdrivers.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Mr._Wizard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Mr._Wizard">Mr. Wizard</a> showed me how when I was just a kid, and I have been doing it every since.&nbsp; Simply take a strong magnet and place it on the tip.&nbsp; Now slide it down the shaft, away from the tip in only one direction - do not twist the magnet around the shaft.&nbsp; This polarizes the shaft with the electrons that were resting at one end now oppositely charged at the other end of the shaft (because you moved the magnet).&nbsp; You can also de-magnetize by reversing precisely what you just did (place the magnet at the far end, and slide it towards the tip).&nbsp; This does not always work because you need to be using the same pole (North or South) of the magnet that when you started.&nbsp; Using the opposite pole will not have much effect.&nbsp; 
</p>


<p>Do not worry.&nbsp; Just slide the magnet down the shaft and be done.&nbsp; And do not magnetize all of your tools.&nbsp; Just two or three select screwdrivers, and keep them away from your other tools so they do not magnetize others.&nbsp; Note that I highly recommend the use of <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/770f/" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/770f/">rare-Earth magnets</a> as they are extremely strong. 
</p>


<p>And before you ask, yes I removed the HDD before using tools that were magnetized. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Above: nVidia quadro FX2500m, Below: ATI X1400" width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0015.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0015.jpg"> <br><b>Above: nVidia quadro FX2500m, Below: ATI X1400</b></p>




<p align="left">Here is the view of the ATI X1400 still in the system and the new nVidia FX2500m for comparison.&nbsp; Notice there is no heat pipe on the left side of the ATI card, only the right side.&nbsp; </p>




<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Above: ATI X1400, Below: nVidia FX2500m " width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0020.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0020.jpg"> <br><b>Above: ATI X1400, Below: nVidia FX2500m</b> </p>




<p>Here you can see both cards and really see what others are calling &#8220;dual heat pipes&#8221; on the nVidia 7900 GTX (below). 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Modifying the case to fit the FX2500m" width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0021.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0021.jpg"> <br><b>Modifying the case to fit the FX2500m</b> </p>




<p>Now for the point of no return.&nbsp; To get the nVidia FX2500m to fit, you will need to modify the left-rear area of the laptop case behind the CPU&#8217;s heatsink.&nbsp; This is because the left heatsink for the FX2500m is too wide to fit into this area.&nbsp; So you have to grind down or break off the two plastic sides/tabs.&nbsp; You can see in this photo above that I am grabbing one of the tabs to break off with a pair of needle-nose pliers. 
</p>


<p>Another option that would keep your full warranty would be to modify the FX2500m&#8217;s heatsink by grinding down the two ends.&nbsp; I believe this would fit well with slight bending on the copper pipe to raise the heatsink about 1/8&#8221;.&nbsp; This does not block air-flow for the cpu&#8217;s heatsink, and still is vented to the rear outlet.&nbsp; Alas I do not have a grinder here, or I would have done it myself. 
</p>


<p>Do not worry about warranty here.&nbsp; If you are going this far, then you have the ability to service the laptop yourself if a component fails during your warranty period.&nbsp; Dell&#8217;s &#8220;low cost&#8221; warranty is parts-only, and there ya go.&nbsp; Dell will send you the parts to replace, which you can service it yourself - under warranty.&nbsp; Just I would not take the chance of sending the entire laptop in for repair as they may catch the broken tabs. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Right Tab Modified" width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0024.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0024.jpg"> <br><b>Right Tab Modified</b></p>

<p>You can see above it does not take very much.&nbsp; Test fit the FX2500m a few times though to make sure you removed enough. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="CPU &amp; Northbridge Heatpipe/Heatsink Removed " width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0025.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0025.jpg"> <br><b>CPU &amp; Northbridge Heatpipe/Heatsink Removed</b> </p>




<p>While I had my system apart, I made plans to upgrade the CPU&#8217;s cooling a little with a touch of Arctic Silver 5 as I noted above.&nbsp; You can see in this photo above the crap that Dell (and most PC makers) use on their CPUs.&nbsp; Mine had actually turned into a brittle paste. 
</p>


<p align="center"><a target="_blank" mce_href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026.jpg" href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Cleaned CPU and Northbridge" width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026_thumb.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026_thumb.jpg"></a> <br><b>Cleaned CPU and Northbridge</b> <br>(CLICK FOR JPEG COMPRESSED 1.43 MB FULL-RES PICTURE FOR DETAIL/CLOSE-UP)</p>




<p>Before you can apply AS5, you must thoroughly clean both surfaces (the CPU and heatsink).&nbsp; My best experiences has always been to use rubbing alcohol with some lint-free clothes or even kitchen paper towels.&nbsp; AS5 works smaller than you can see, filling the microscopic gaps and imperfections of the two pieces.&nbsp; Above you can see how the CPU&#8217;s surface is now mirror-like, reflecting the white water-bottle cap.&nbsp; 
</p>


<p>The copper heatpipe was another story though.&nbsp; It was extremely rough and the paste was near-impossible to remove.&nbsp; Sorry I forgot to snap a photo of my work, because of the time involved I was just in a hurry to get it polished down.&nbsp; But I ended up using 400grit sandpaper, than 1000grit, and 2000grit to get a near-polished surface.&nbsp; You do not have to do any of this to your heatpipe though.&nbsp; Just get it cleaned off. 
</p>


<p>I went this route of applying AS5 and polishing my heatpipe because I did not like my CPU&#8217;s temps under normal conditions just idling and/or working.&nbsp; I wanted to cool down the 62C idle of my CPU!&nbsp; I am proud to say that using AS5 did the trick.&nbsp; My idle temps are down to 37C with ambient about 74F.&nbsp; For comparison, my 4.2 Ghz desktop noted above idles at 28C but that&#8217;s not fair given the custom cooling I did with it.&nbsp; But, it&#8217;s close! 
</p>

<p>Here is a shot of everything re-installed and tightened down.&nbsp; Note in comparison to a photo above of the ATI X1400 in the system.

<p align="center"><a target="_blank" mce_href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0030.jpg" href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0030.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Air gaps from Dell's stock setup of heatsinks" width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0030_thumb.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0030_thumb.jpg"></a> <br><b>Air gaps from Dell&#8217;s stock setup of heatsinks<br></b>(CLICK FOR JPEG COMPRESSED 1.32 MB FULL-RES PICTURE FOR DETAIL/CLOSE-UP)</p>




<p>Now this was something I was not happy about.&nbsp; There is a large gap from the left fan (fan 1) to the CPU&#8217;s heatsink from before.&nbsp; Then there was now a gap between the CPU and GPU&#8217;s heatsinks.&nbsp; You can see in the picture above the screwdriver that is clearly visible (click the image for the full-res version).</p>




<p>In my history of custom cooling back in the 80s and 90s, there is one thing I learned that always remains constant: airflow is key.&nbsp; So my task would be to modify the airflow to force all air through the heatsinks by not allowing any to escape the airflow path through any gaps. 
</p>


<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Aluminum Foil Shrouds" width="644" height="431" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0031.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0031.jpg"> <br><b>Aluminum Foil Shrouds</b></p>




<p>I accomplished this by using a few pieces of kitchen aluminum foil, scotch-tape, and additional AS5.&nbsp; There are multiple reasons for this.&nbsp; First for safety I evaluated the entire area and found no electrical components or circuit boards anywhere near this area.&nbsp; You do not want a piece coming loose and short-circuiting things!&nbsp; </p>




<p>Second is having aluminum foil allows the heat to transfer from one copper pipe to the other (just a tad though, too thin really to do a massive amount).&nbsp; That may not have been the best idea at first because CPUs usually run cooler than GPUs from my overclocking experience.&nbsp; But considering how freakin&#8217; high my CPU temps were before I even began, I could only see this as helping to offload some heat to the GPU&#8217;s heatpipe - even if just a tad amount, anything had to help. 
</p>


<p>I also closed down the air escaping on the left side of fan&#8217;s outlet to the CPU&#8217;s heatsink, as well as the gaps between the two heatsinks.&nbsp; Now all air is forced by the fan trough the CPU heatsink, and then through the GPU&#8217;s heatsink where it than only has room to exit the back vent. 
</p>


<p align="center"><a mce_href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle.jpg" href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="CPU idle at 36C using Arctic Silver 5, down from 62C when OEM" width="644" height="484" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle_thumb.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle_thumb.jpg"></a>&nbsp;<br><b>CPU idle at 36C using Arctic Silver 5, down from 62C when OEM</b></p>




<p>It is very well worth it, even if I did not upgrade the GPU, because now my CPU temps are a steady 37C with fans set to low.&nbsp; With no fans, it creeps up to 47C.&nbsp; Compare that to the 62C idle before with fans on high, and I think I came out ahead.&nbsp; </p>




<p align="center"><a mce_href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95.jpg" href="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="CPU cores pegged reaches 72C after 30 minutes of stress-testing, down from much much higher" width="639" height="484" mce_src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95_thumb.jpg" src="/blog/archives/images/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95_thumb.jpg"></a>&nbsp;<br><b>CPU cores pegged reaches 72C after 30 minutes of stress-testing, down from much much higher</b></p>




<p>And for you guys into max CPU heat testing, using an instance of Prime95 on each core yields a max temp of 72C with 74F ambient after about 30 minutes.&nbsp; Much better than before!&nbsp; I will admit I did not pay a lot of attention to the max temp before the AS5 was applied.&nbsp; Let us just say I did not stress it for very long once it climbed to 85C.</p>




<p>While gaming the GPU hovered around 63 to 65C tonight after about two hours, and peaked at 70C just for an instant. I would have applied AS5 to the GPU&#8217;s heatsink but I did not have a torx-bit small enough (it was missing from my collection) and I wanted to get my laptop running again after spending that time sanding down the CPU&#8217;s heatpipe. 
</p>


<p>In conclusion, I feel this was very much worth the effort.&nbsp; A few hours of research over a few days time, finding a great deal on the video card, and planning/preparation before hand, and it all took about 3 hours from start to end (including the sanding of the CPU&#8217;s heatpipe).&nbsp; 
</p>


<p>Not a bad system for under $1,200 with BF2 averaging in Fraps at 85 FPS and BF2142 around 78 FPS steady.&nbsp; Why someone would pay for an XPS system is beyond me.&nbsp; Just get an Inspiron for a good price, hunt around after a few months find a deal on the upgrade parts.&nbsp; </p>




<p>Now, if I can get my hands on one of those newer 1720/1730s with dual HDD bays&#8230; </p>
