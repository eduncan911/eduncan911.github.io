<P><IMG src="/blog/archives/images/ticket-writing.jpg" border=0></P>


<p><P>17.8 MPG vs 24.1 MPG.&nbsp; Read on&hellip;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&rdquo; />&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I can not count the number of driving schools I&rsquo;ve been to that got me out of a speeding ticket.&nbsp; I know I had 7 in Davidson Co. in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &ldquo;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&rdquo; />&lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Nashville&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City> alone, and I only lived there 6 years.&nbsp; Not to mention the countless counties I have received driving citations in across the country, and have driven back only to go to court and plea for driving school &ndash; which I get 19/20 times it seems.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I always learn something new with these schools too.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t just sit back and wing it.&nbsp; I actually do read, as I learn some new habit all the time.&nbsp; Recently, it was the new way the government wants you to place your hands.&nbsp; No longer at 10 and 2, but at 8 and 4.&nbsp; This lowers the chances of you breaking your arms in an airbag going off, where at 10 and 2, you have a high chance of injury to your arms in rollovers and side impact collisions with your left arm being strung out the window.</P>
<P>I find myself quite proud to have an extremely thick &ldquo;Driving Citations&rdquo; folder in my filing cabinet at home, of which I always went to court and plead.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t matter if it was in KY, GA, or even a&nbsp;bonsai run all the way to &lt;st1:State w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Florida&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:State>&nbsp;for court, sign the driving school plea, and drive back to TN at the&nbsp;time.&nbsp; &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Why?&nbsp; My driving record has been clean for almost 8 years now and when you start to total up how much&nbsp;each one of those tickets would have cost me in my &ldquo;Good Driver&rdquo; discount at my insurance, not to mention running the risk of getting my license suspended, it makes sense of why I did that.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I cruise along the Dallas North Tollway at around 75 to 85 MPH &ndash; speed limit 55mph.&nbsp; Travel distance is about&nbsp;34 miles on the Tollway every day to and from work.&nbsp; Mostly try to stay in the center, but people just don&rsquo;t get over.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Do I tailgate?&nbsp; Very seldom, if not at all.&nbsp; Within these driving school&nbsp;courses I read and answer the side-bar quizzes like &ldquo;Are you an aggressive driver?&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; I answer no to tailgating often.&nbsp; &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>There&rsquo;s also a question like, &ldquo;Do you have to pass every car on the road?&rdquo;&nbsp; I try to answer seldom, but I think back to my college days of where I was proud to count each car I pass, and how many passed me from my weekly commutes from &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Chattanooga&lt;/st1:City> to &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Nashville&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City>.&nbsp; I think the record was 180 something cars I passed &ndash;&nbsp;1 passed me.&nbsp; The &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Nashville&lt;/st1:City> to &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Atlanta&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City> sprints are even more horrendous at 300+ cars passed, if I could keep count with booking at 130+ MPH quite often.&nbsp; Zero cars passing me.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>When moving to &lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Dallas&lt;/st1:City>, &lt;st1:State w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>TX&lt;/st1:State>&lt;/st1:place> I slowed down a bit.&nbsp; Cruising at 80 MPH or so.&nbsp; If a car comes up behind me with plenty of warning, sure I&rsquo;ll move over and let ya pass.&nbsp; If a car comes out of no where and tailgates my ass, I won&rsquo;t slow down or speed up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just wait until I have room to get over, and will then move over.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I follow the Good Driver rules such as scanning your mirrors ever 10 seconds (especially the rearview)&nbsp;and be absolutely mindful of your entire surroundings, knowing where each car is in each lane next to you within 20&#8217;.&nbsp; This is just good driving habits and has saved me from countless near-collisions from someone being a jerk or an ass.&nbsp; Nothing should be taking you from concentrating on this, and it&rsquo;s what I do every second in the car.&nbsp; Cell phones?&nbsp; I hate my friends talking to me while driving.&nbsp; I do it with an ear piece, but I hate it when I do and usually try to pull over.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Road Rage.&nbsp; Who here hasn&rsquo;t had Road Rage?&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; Only once ever in my life, and I still don&rsquo;t know how I pissed off that guy.&nbsp; I had cruise on at 65mph into 55, in the right lane,&nbsp;was passing an 18 wheeler on the right and this guy drove through the right-emergency lane and threw a beer bottle into my convertible &ndash; an open beer bottle!&nbsp; Hitting my friend in the head, and spilling beer all over me.&nbsp; Short outcome, I let it go after 10 minutes of rage.&nbsp; Punk.&nbsp; I was 21 then.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>All other times drivers have gotten pissed at me for going a bit too fast?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; I find it actually humorous that they can&rsquo;t control their rage.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll play the traffic smart, inching over one lane, passing a car slowly.&nbsp; And trapping them in traffic &ndash; which makes them even more mad.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had a few yell at me and threaten me.&nbsp; I give them the &ldquo;Hello.&nbsp; Have a nice day.&rdquo; smile and look, and exit the next ramp, to where they can&rsquo;t follow.&nbsp; Next.&nbsp; &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I could keep going on about my habits, but I do consider myself a fairly safe driver &ndash; to others.&nbsp; If I am driving at 95mph, it is with no other vehicles around me.&nbsp; If I come up onto a car in the right lane, I slow to 80 or so, so not to scare them too much.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I know about being courteous, and try to as often as I can.&nbsp; Finding myself giving the right-away to far too many jerks here in &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Dallas&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City>.&nbsp; But yet, I just sit back and ease back up to 80 or so on the Tollway.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let them get the ticket.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I&rsquo;ve noticed &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Dallas&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City> drivers have a bad habit of what I like to call&nbsp;Pacing Syndrome.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t bother me, but it pisses the guy off that&rsquo;s tailing-gating me because he can not get ahead.&nbsp; What is Pacing Syndrome?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s when two cars are pacing each other, in two different lanes,&nbsp; blocking others from passing.&nbsp; This is not intentional as it&rsquo;s usually&nbsp;this way far up the road ahead, with two cars all by themselves within a car length of each other.&nbsp; The one on the&nbsp;left just isn&rsquo;t aware enough of their surroundings at all.&nbsp; Nor are they aware that it&rsquo;s courteous to move over to the right, where you won&rsquo;t loose any speed, and pace the car in front of you.&nbsp; Instead, they are side by side.&nbsp; Sometimes even 3 wide.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>This becomes an issue with I&rsquo;m cruising at 80 MPH, and slow smoothly down to 60 or so to where they are pacing &ndash; now I have a number of cars behind me beeping and flashing their lights.&nbsp; What am I suppose to do?&nbsp; I get over (I usually do!), and bam &ndash; now they move up to&nbsp;tailgate the car in the left lane &ndash; which sometimes pisses off the left-lane guy even more.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ve seen Road Rage ensure from this here in &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Dallas&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City>.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Just be mindful of your surroundings, and please move over!&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.</P>
<P>There&rsquo;s another driving school lesson that I learned a long time ago, and 99% of people on the road need to learn.&nbsp; Road Rage is not only getting mad, but it&rsquo;s causing the others to get mad as well.&nbsp; Even though I found it funny when they got mad, I was myself entising even more rage from them.</P>
<P>A common example of this are the pricks that speed up to block someone from getting over.&nbsp; That, you all have to agree, is the single worse habit a driver could have.&nbsp; How many times have you been stuck by someone goofball speeding up, closing their gap for the car in front of you, to block you from getting over?</P>
<P>Now I am not talking those small 2-car length areas they close quickly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m talking to where you have your blinker on, in hopes they see you and let you over.&nbsp; Instead, they speed up.&nbsp; Entising Road Rage I&rsquo;ll admit, I usually just move on over anyhow.&nbsp; I need a new paint job of them rear-ending me if they do &ndash; but they will not.</P>
<P>Me?&nbsp; I never close the gap.&nbsp; Even if it&rsquo;s a prick darting in and out of traffic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; you ask?&nbsp; Because it is not worth it.&nbsp; Now if they do slip in one of those small 2 car-length spaces I&rsquo;ve left open (traffic), I do retaliate a bit.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; I keep the exact same distance they got when they squeezed in.&nbsp; I rationalize this by thinking, &ldquo;Ok, if you think you had enough room to squeeze in, 6&#8217; from my bumper &ndash; I&rsquo;ll leave you 6&#8217; of room until you move back over up the road somewhere.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Yes, that&rsquo;s tailgating.&nbsp; But they thought they had enough room when then squeezed in right?&nbsp; So I leave them what they thought was adiquate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Finally, two Mondays ago&nbsp;after hearing all about gas prices increasing I start to wonder if I should slow down &ndash; drive like Granny in the hot rod Lincoln.&nbsp; I go to fill up and, WTF, $55?&nbsp; I look on the ground for a hole for gas to be leaking, but realize that Premium was $3.29.&nbsp; &lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>I shake my head and decide then, to pull the chip and drive like granny last week.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Best gas mileage I got in the hot rod &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Lincoln&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City> driving like I was before was around 17.8 MPG.&nbsp; I never could break 18 MPG.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>This morning I filled up today, and noticed I&rsquo;ve gone for well over a week without filling &ndash; a first here in &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Dallas&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City>.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>How about 24.1 MPG?&nbsp; Now this did not come easy.&nbsp; I have been driving like Granny with an Instant MPG digital readout on the dash.&nbsp; And let me tell you, it&rsquo;s very hard to drive to where that sucker says 20 MPG or higher at all times.&nbsp; VERY hard.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Try keeping your speed at 55 to 60 MPH on the Tollway, with all of the dips and going up the dips?&nbsp; Not possible.&nbsp; Try accelerating from a red light.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to keep the RPMs under 1500 RPMs.&nbsp; Not easy to do in a hot rod &lt;st1:City w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>&lt;st1:place w:st=&ldquo;on&rdquo;>Lincoln&lt;/st1:place>&lt;/st1:City> that loves hole-shots with the 3000 Stall, HiPo transmission, and custom tune.&nbsp; And God forbid that a light that is red and I&rsquo;m slowing down for turns green &ndash; the Instant MPG drops to 5 MPG.&nbsp; Doh!&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>The moral of this post?&nbsp; To where I thought I wasn&rsquo;t an aggressive driver, after all of the schools, tickets, citations, running from the cops (oops, didn&rsquo;t mean that), peeling out, barking 2nd gear, smoking 4th in the Cobra, etc over the last decade&hellip;&nbsp; Nothing was as much clear to me to when I found out about the gas I have been wasting over the years.&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
<P>Damn.&nbsp; I actually was an aggressive driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;But not any more.&nbsp; :)&lt;o:p>&lt;/o:p></P>
