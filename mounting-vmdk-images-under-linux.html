<p>I recently converted my Lenovo ThinkPad Helix touch device over to Linux (Antergos/ArchLinux) and needed to bring over
my development files from my old VMware vmdk file images.</p>

<h2>Problem: kpartx no longer works with vmdk</h2>

<p>In the past, one could use <code>kpartx</code> to simply expose the block devices to mount.  But this isn&rsquo;t working as of 2016 and the latest vmdk (at least not for me).</p>

<p>It must be an Arch thing as things would work under Ubuntu as of late 2015.  Anyhoot&hellip;</p>

<h2>Convert VMDK to VDI</h2>

<p>What I ended up doing was to convert the vmdk file over to VirtualBox&rsquo;s vdi format.</p>

<pre><code># vboxmanage clonehd --format VDI wash-sda.vmdk wash-sda.vdi
0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
Clone medium created in format 'VDI'. UUID: 65b26588-946c-46c2-aa26-7c43783dd0cc
</code></pre>

<h2>Expose VDI as block device using QEMU</h2>

<p>kpartx continued to return empty on this vdi.  So, next steps was to use QEMU for the network block device.</p>

<pre><code># modprobe nbd max_part=16
# qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 wash-sda.vdi
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see what <code>kpartx</code> shows.</p>

<pre><code># kpartx -l /dev/nbd0 
nbd0p1 : 0 1048576 /dev/nbd0 2048
nbd0p2 : 0 248510465 /dev/nbd0 1050624
</code></pre>

<p>Bingo!  There are my two partitions from my very valuable dev VM: /boot and / (root) respectfully!</p>

<h2>Mount the partitions with kpartx</h2>

<p>With the partitions now known, we can use kpartx to create the loopback devices.</p>

<pre><code># kpartx -av /dev/nbd0 
add map nbd0p1 (254:1): 0 1048576 linear 43:0 2048
add map nbd0p2 (254:2): 0 248510465 linear 43:0 1050624
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>All that is left now is to mount them:</p>

<pre><code># mount /dev/mapper/nbd0p1 /mnt/wash/boot
# mount /dev/mapper/nbd0p2 /mnt/wash/root
</code></pre>

<p>And there we have it.</p>

<p>It was more complicated then I&rsquo;d like (converting to another format, doubling the space) and would take a while to convert back to vmdk.  But for my needs,
of just moving my dev files over from an outdated VM, this is all I needed.</p>
