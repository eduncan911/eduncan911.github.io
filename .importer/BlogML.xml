      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Toolbars no more!]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>The Yahoo!'s Toolbar.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Google's Toolbar.&nbsp; The&nbsp;MSN Toolbar.&nbsp; The "I'm a company, use our toolbar" Toolbar.</P>
<P>These were cool for about 15 minutes, as it allowed quick searches for the search engine you prefer to use.&nbsp; They also were very nifty by having the ability to block PopUp windows.</P>
<P>My current viewpoint of these?&nbsp; GET RID OF THEM!!!&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is no need for them any longer.&nbsp; Zip, nada, none.&nbsp; All they do is use system resources (memory, delay your browse from opening faster, etc).&nbsp; Yet adding to the confusion and messing up the User Experience.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now some may ask, "Wait, I want the popup blocker!!"&nbsp; You already have a PopUp blocker built INTO Internet Explorer (<A HREF="/blogs/eduncan911/archive/2005/05/21/150.aspx" target=_blank>once you install Service Pack 2</A>).</P>
<P>Ok, what about quick searches you may ask?&nbsp; Easy, install a Microsoft-now-distributed PowerToy called TweakUI (<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx</A>).&nbsp; Once installed, open it and browse to <STRONG>Internet Explorer</STRONG>, <STRONG>Search</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Here are the built-in keyword shortcuts for searching.&nbsp; Google isn't installed by default, so I add it by clicking Create, enter the letter "g", and use this 'special' URL:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%s">http://www.google.com/search?q=%s</A></P>
<P>Notice the %s.&nbsp; This is described in the Create window.&nbsp; You can use this format for Yahoo, MSN (even though MSN is built-in).</P>
<P>Now, when I want to search Google, I open a browser (which you have to do anyhow for the Toolbar app if you had one), and in the URL type:</P>
<P>g Braves Baseball&lt;press enter&gt;</P>
<P>BAM, I now have Google results for Braves Baseball.&nbsp; :)</P>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[WindowsXP Service Pack 2 (SP2)]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>This is another reason Mac users stick to the Macs.&nbsp; It's 'cause of crap like these Toolbars and Firewall add-on applications that annoying the hell out of you/takes away from the User Expierence.&nbsp; Get rid of them all!&nbsp; Go back to the way Windows was originally thought of, simple Windows that allows you to get your work done.</P>
<P>I know I know.&nbsp; This is an old topic.&nbsp; Hey, my blog is online now.&nbsp; So I'm going to rant.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>Some might still be frighten and may not have this installed.&nbsp; Install it.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It doesn't hinder me, as an extreme poweruser.&nbsp; I program in many different langauges and tools (from Visual Studio .NET, to Dreamweaver, to breaking out VS6 occassionally for old software).&nbsp; Not to mention Java and graphics/video editting.&nbsp; No problems here.</P>
<P>The benifits far out-weigh any large download or whatnots.</P>
<P><STRONG>Built-In PopUp Blocker</STRONG><BR>Yes, that's right.&nbsp; You no longer need those resource hogging Toolbars!&nbsp; Use the built-in features of SP2.</P>
<P><STRONG>Excellent Kernel-Level Firewall (and yes, it blocks OUTGOING too!)</STRONG><BR>Some people are dedicated ZoneAlarm gurus (with paid subscriptions).&nbsp; Some have been frightened into not trusting their LinkSys router with firewall cause of the extreme hackers that still take them down (this is true, but only if you are targetted by someone specifically).</P>
<P>There's no need for any of this, period.&nbsp; Now don't get this SP2 Firewall confused with the firewall in the standard XP and the one with SP1.&nbsp; This one is COMPLETELY differently, now embedded into the system's kernel (if you don't know what the kernel is, just rest assured that it's at the ground level now instead of just an application level before).</P>
<P>Yes, it blocks outgoing as well.&nbsp; And it even notifies you that it has blocked an application with a nice little baloon popup.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>The last ZoneAlarm Pro I debugged (had to fix) annoyed the hell out of me!&nbsp; All of those warnings, huge popup windows, etc.&nbsp; Why someone would use that, especially complete-handicapped people I have no idea.&nbsp; It only adds to the extreme confusion of the Internet.</P>
<P>Yes, ZoneAlarm keeps stats but there's no need for that crap.&nbsp; It's useless information (not to mention annoying).&nbsp; Doesn't matter if you were attacked 10 or 10,000 times.&nbsp; Compromised servers out there on the net will continue to hit your machine.&nbsp; </P>]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Now what prompted me to write up <A href="/blogs/eduncan911/archive/2005/05/21/get_rid_of_those_toolbars.aspx">why you don't need Toolbar applications any longer </A>was because of the&nbsp;mess of Included Software now for applications you normally download.&nbsp; From reputable&nbsp;sources!</P>
<P>The RealOne player tries to sneak you into installing Yahoo!'s Toolbar on their homepage.&nbsp; Even after that, it STILL tries to install Yahoo!'s Toolbar on installation.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The QuickTime installer tries to sneak in the Yahoo! bar.&nbsp; As well as the Adobe Reader 7.0.&nbsp; Windows Media Player tries to sneak in the MSN Toolbar.&nbsp; And another freeway app tries to sneak in Google's (from a machine I was setting up today).</P>
<P>Don't you just want to SLAP the bastards?&nbsp; I feel very sorry for end-users that aren't catching this.&nbsp; They'll have all sorts of Toolbars installed.</P>
<P>I understand each company is trying to push some advertising/steer users to their websites (Google, MSN, or Yahoo!)&nbsp;to generate additional income.&nbsp; But guys, WE ARE FIGURING IT OUT!&nbsp; They are getting as bad as SpyWare crap now, bogging down our machines.</P>

<P>Not to mention how these applications always think they are the best for playing ALL of your media, movie files, MP3s, etc so they&nbsp;always assume we want Real Player to open my mp3 files and play them.&nbsp; NO!!!</P>
<P>Not to mention all of that time you fought to remove them from the StartUp procedure (running in the tooltray, in the background for NO reason) is gone because when update them, they feel the need to load themselves in the background for "quicker launching".&nbsp; I'm sorry, I hardly every watch MOV files online.&nbsp; So why would I want QuickTime running in my tooltray, along with 15 other players and applications?</P>
<P>Now I'm talking updating software like media players, readers, Flash/multimedia, etc.&nbsp; Those little applications we need to browse the web daily and listen to audio files and such.&nbsp; Obviously mainstream applications need updates to fix bugs and large new features.</P>
<P>I have yet to see a reason for me to upgrade to the latest Adobe.&nbsp; I'm running Adobe Reader 5.0.&nbsp; Small, lightweight, loads fairly quickly.&nbsp; I really preferred version 4.0 of the reader as it was fast.&nbsp; But I have Adobe's PDF creator software, which is version 5.0.&nbsp; So I'm on 5.0 now.</P>
<P>I'm running WinAMP 2.61.&nbsp; No, that's not a misprint.&nbsp; Yes, I've been running the same verion since 2000.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; All shoutcast streams work just fine, as well as MP3 playing.&nbsp; I don't want WinAMP to take over as my Media Player of choice, so there's no reason to upgrade.&nbsp; Heck, even plug-ins for WinAMP 5.0 work just fine in 2.61!&nbsp; Also, 2.61 doesn't force "reporting" or behind-the-scenes of contacting WinAMP to report back on statistics.&nbsp; It's extremely lightweight, and very non-intrusive.</P>
<P>AOL Instant Messenger.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the version number is, but I've been using the same messenger since 2000!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; It's fast, lightweight, and <STRONG>doesn't have those annoying talking ads</STRONG>!&nbsp; Actually I no longer use AIM's client (nor ICQ or Yahoo) as running all of them was too bulky.&nbsp; I now use Trillian.&nbsp; And the only reason I keep updating Trillian is because one of the IM servers will change something, so I have to update to get a version that works.</P>
<P>Now RealOne needs to be slapped.&nbsp; I tried to run 8.0 of their player because they changed the name to RealOne.&nbsp; Then a lot of content because RealOne-only content so I had to update.&nbsp; Get this, Real has figured out a way to force users to upgrade.&nbsp; Their players expire!&nbsp; Even though I haven't seen one expire in the past 6 months (maybe the consumers got pissed off, like me).&nbsp; Perhaps that force upgrade was because it was the first RealOne release.</P>
<P><STRONG>Microsoft products</STRONG><BR>Ok, now these I do update as often as I can as they just get better and betters.&nbsp; Like Office and WMP and MSN Money, MSN Messenger,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; I don't like how bloated Windows Media Player 10 has gotten, but they always seem to be improving performance, along with adding features (unlike ANY of the others above mentioned).&nbsp; With a little tweaking of the settings, WMP10 can load right up to display the library or Playing Now tab instead of the default Guide or What's Hot webpages (where it contacts MS and downloads content).&nbsp; Then it loads quickly.</P>
<P>I'd actually like to see Microsoft release a lightweight Media Player, like the old 6.4 version (that works with almost ALL content right now, btw!).&nbsp; Maybe call it Windows Media Player Light" that is strictly used for web browsing and streaming.&nbsp; Loading WMP10, the library of MP3 files I have, checking for updates, etc seems quite large for an application that I simply want to stream a Shoutcast stream with and run in the background while I work (and taking up almost 25MB of memory!).</P>
<P>WMP10 is still too bulky for me to load in the background while I work.&nbsp; So I still use WinAMP 2.61 in the background to stream my MP3 collection and stream the ShoutCast stations I've come to love.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The moral of the story is&nbsp;if you see a popup that says, "Your X program is out of date" or "There is a newer version of X program", don't upgrade.&nbsp; Click the "Don't remind me" button and keep working.&nbsp; </P>]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Dump the router!]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>*** UPDATE: Please read the whole post.&nbsp; The point was that older routers are causing issues.&nbsp; The 802.11G I tested recently resolves most of these issues, even though ping rates were about 5% higher on average (over an hour each).</P>
<P>Yes, you heard me right.&nbsp; Well, dump the router for a newer one with an 100Mbps external connection.&nbsp; Read on...</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5><FONT size=3>Packet Loss</FONT><BR></FONT></STRONG>This week Comcast upgraded their network and our (I'll get the 'our' part in a bit) 5+ year old cable modem started getting 30 to 40% packet loss, to Comcast's network!&nbsp; I tested it here to my servers at Datapipe.net, and Comcast tested the actual modem itself (computer disconnected).&nbsp; Dang, time to upgrade.</P>
<P>The 'our' part is that I share my neighbor's Internet connection.&nbsp; I bought wireless cards and a wifi router ~5 years ago to do this (802.11b at the time, first ones).&nbsp; I've only gotten about 1.4 to 2.0Mbps.&nbsp; Sometimes I had the cable modem here with the router and directly connected to it.&nbsp; Then I was able to see about 2.8Mbps.</P>
<P>Today I decided to go all out and get Comcast Internet with the Premium service (6Mbps download, 768kbps upload).&nbsp; They had a special, $29.95/mo for 6 months.&nbsp; Premium service is $10/mo more ($39.95 total).&nbsp;&nbsp;Picked up the modem and stuff today and ran the new wires, etc.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I also found an awesome new Bandwidth Test website: <A href="http://www.testmy.net/">www.testmy.net</A>&nbsp; No more DSLReports for me.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5><FONT size=3>WiFi?&nbsp; No Thank you.</FONT><BR></FONT></STRONG>Humm, only got 1.4Mbps (I'm wireless, not directly connected).&nbsp; Checking my 802.11b, I'm connected at 11Mbps, no encryption (slows things down).&nbsp; Hum, must be something else.&nbsp; But I went ahead and connected a cable to directly connect the router (for a 100Mbps connection to the router).&nbsp; Wow, it jumped to 2.8Mbps.&nbsp; Verdict: No more WiFi for me (well, may try 802.11g).</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5><FONT size=3>10Mbps is a Joke</FONT><BR></FONT></STRONG>I'm still at 2.8Mbps, and I am paying for 6Mbps.&nbsp; I found a post on testmy.net/forums that a guy was paying for 9Mbps down and 1Mbps up (Charter), but was only getting about my speeds as well until he removed the router.&nbsp; So I did that today.&nbsp; Turned on <A href="/blogs/eduncan911/archive/2005/05/21/150.aspx">XP SP2's Firewall</A>, disconnected the router and connected directly to the modem.&nbsp; Looking at my connection speed to the modem,&nbsp;it was 100Mbps.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Whoa, my speeds jumped to 3.9Mbps/369kbps!&nbsp; Humm, to me that's the standard 4Mbps/384kbps speed Comcast has.&nbsp; Not my Premium speeds.&nbsp; So I gave Comcast a call.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had to provision the modem to enable the faster speeds (Isn't this suppose to be automatic?&nbsp; Makes me wonder who many of you aren't provisioned for the extra speeds).</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=5><FONT size=3>Oh My...!!!</FONT><BR></FONT></STRONG>After a few resets of the modem and a "wait about 15 minutes before testing again", I tested it again...&nbsp; DAMN!</P>
<P>:::.. Download Stats ..::: <BR>Connection is:: 5473 Kbps about <STRONG>5.5 Mbps</STRONG> (tested with 20972 kB) <BR>Download Speed is:: 668 kB/s <BR>Bottom Line:: 98X faster than 56K 1MB download in 1.53 sec <BR>Diagnosis: <STRONG>Awesome! 20% + : 52.54 % faster than the average for host (comcast.net)</STRONG> <BR>Validation Link:: <A href="http://testmy.net/stats/id-5TQ7843H9" target=_blank>http://testmy.net/stats/id-5TQ7843H9</A> <BR><BR><BR>:::.. Upload Stats ..::: <BR>Connection is:: <STRONG>663 Kbps</STRONG> about 0.7 Mbps (tested with 579 kB) <BR>Upload Speed is:: 81 kB/s <BR>Bottom Line:: 12X faster than 56K 1MB upload in 12.64 sec <BR>Diagnosis: <STRONG>Awesome! 20% + : 93.86 % faster than the average for host (comcast.net)</STRONG> <BR>Validation Link:: <A href="http://testmy.net/stats/id-NT867RMYC" target=_blank>http://testmy.net/stats/id-NT867RMYC</A> </P>
<P>Verdict: I guess I need to&nbsp;get a wifi router with 802.11g and the faster external port to get my faster speeds I am paying for!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Hope this helps those of you that aren't getting 4Mbps from your Comcast in Nashville.</P>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Sorry but dumping a router is not a great bandwidth solution, maybe avoiding the conversation, but not the solution. I hit similar speeds on the Premium tier with a WiFi G router. I will admit that tuning the router will help adjust the overhead. I noticed the best performance gain with MAC address filter on shuting out all the "noise".

I do notice a loss in bandwidth of Wifi G vs. being on a hard line. Not sure why that should be the case and think WiFi overhead is being oversold. I guess you can hit 54M if you are 2 feet from the base station and glowing from all the RF around you :-)]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I was never able to get full 100Mbps out of a 100Mbps switch and two PCs.  I've never been able to get 10Mbps out of a 10Mbps connection to another device.  What I am getting at is this old (we are talking old guys, no fireware update for my Linksys) router with an external 10Mbps connection is hendering me.  I've proved this with a 802.11 "G" router today that has an 100Mbps external port.  I see basically no difference in speeds with or with hte "G" router. If you read the first line of this post, I say dump it for a newer one with an 100Mbps external connection; which basically you two already have.  :) My original Linksys "B" WiFi router aint up to the ask (retested after I got the G to make sure).  I only get about 2.8Mbps with the "B" router hooked up (connected to it's switch, not wifi) and I see the full 6Mbps if I switch to the "G".  No firmware upgrade for my "B" router, so that's the end of the store.  ]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Gmail has a neat feature of allowing you to enter aliases with your email address.&nbsp; This is a nice trick to help find the source of why you are now getting upteen thousand spam emails in your GMail account.</P>
<P>For exmaple, my email address is in the form of (this is a fake email, to keep spam bots from stealing my email address): <A href="mailto:eric@gmail.com" mce_href="mailto:eric@gmail.com">eric@gmail.com</A></P>
<P>To make an alias, just add the plus (+) symbol to your username followed by whatever you want to type.&nbsp; Like: <A href="mailto:eric+forums@gmail.com" mce_href="mailto:eric+forums@gmail.com">eric+forums@gmail.com</A></P>
<P>That's it.&nbsp; There is no setup to do, it works automatically.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp; Send yourself an email to <A href="mailto:myaccount+EricRules@gmail.com">myaccount+EricRules@gmail.com</A>.&nbsp; It will drop right into your Gmail inbox.</P>
<P>I do this a lot for contest or new websites that I have to signup on in order to read content.&nbsp; I've already caught a few sites that I got spam from.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What pisses me off is a lot of PHP websites do not support this "plus" symbol in the email address.&nbsp; Saying it's an invalid email address, or worse just parsing it out!&nbsp; Come on system admins, fix your shit!&nbsp; </P>
<P>(To the Admins) RFC2822, RFC2821, RFC1123, and RFC822 are what you can follow to ensure correct email address formats.&nbsp; Which, yes, includes the "+" symbol!&nbsp; Fix your sites, please.</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[In the 6 years since I made this blog post, this "plus" symbol has become invaluable to me.  I've caught hundreds of sites "sharing" my email address to others.  

I have a Google Applications account for my personal domains (including this domain) and the Gmail Aliases works there too!  Brilliant!

Now I wil admit, the days of "selling" my email to another company seem to be over.  It's more of a company was bought out or merged with a partner, so they gain access to the user base to send emails.  So, the emails seem a bit more valid now.

The companies I have worked for over the years all had Microsoft Exchange, or they migrated to Microsoft Exchange from Google Apps.  I'm sad to say that because of the lack of Aliases with Exchange, I don't like to use Exchange any longer.

It becomes a burden on me to only have 1 email.  Lately, I've had to do a lot of QA testing with registration during development over the years.  Who wants to create an account, go in and delete/rollback entire databases just to use the same email again and again?  No one!  

So, QA teams can really use this feature to its max by signing up with an unlimited amount of accounts, by only using 1 email address + the alias.]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Current &amp;amp;quot;Very Real&amp;amp;quot; eBay Scams - Western Union]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>This is a warning to all about a scan I almost fell into (cause man did I really want the product).</P>
<P>Lately I've been looking for a new laptop, and found the one I'd like to have for about $3800 *sign*.&nbsp; But behold, I found it on eBay for $800!&nbsp; Something must be wrong to be that cheap.&nbsp; And it seems everyday there are dozens of these floating around for $800.&nbsp; So I decided to contact one cause his info seemed complete:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The user had &gt; 200 positive feedbacks, so seemed creditable. 
<LI>The user had been a member for more then 5 years, wow. 
<LI>The user was in OH, claiming he had them in stock.</LI></UL>
<P>The things that tipped me off something was wrong was:</P>
<UL>
<LI>One&nbsp;day only auction (24h) 
<LI>Claiming I must email them to get the laptop for $800, and bluntantly providing their email right on the Auction. 
<LI>Very slight issues in description not quite matching (got to be a geek to spot it, but I did).</LI></UL>
<P>So I emailed them (from a spam email account, that I don't care about getting out), asking for some extremely specific questions.&nbsp; I get back a generic response:</P>
<P><FONT face="Courier New"><FONT size=2>"HI<BR>First I want to tell you that my unit is brand new, unopened box <BR>all&nbsp; accessories included and also an international warranty. <BR>The invoice will come at the same time with the package. <BR>My&nbsp; price is the best you could get: 800USD / unit including the <BR>shipping and insurance taxes. We will pay them because the package <BR>will be delivered from Europe. <BR>As delivery service we use UPS2days air service or overnight&nbsp; (with insurance and <BR>15 days return policy), because it's the faster. And if you will have <BR>a quick payment, we must also have a quick delivery. So that's why we <BR>use as a payment method Western Union money transfer, the fastest and <BR>also very secure way of sending money. <BR>So, if you agree with my terms I'm sure that we can close the deal as soon as possible. <BR>Waiting your quick answer right now,</FONT> "</FONT></P>
<P>Western Union and Europe, two major keywords are that big no no at eBay it seems (after reading several complaints on the Internet and on eBay's site).&nbsp; Here's a link to making sure you protect yourself from purchases:</P>
<P><A href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/confidence/isgw-buyer-tips.html">http://pages.ebay.com/help/confidence/isgw-buyer-tips.html</A></P>
<P>To report these jokers was no easy task, as it seems eBay is a bit hard to navigate.&nbsp; But I did find this link&nbsp;within it (about 1/2 way down), you can report them:</P>
<P><A href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/rfe-spam-non-ebay-sale.html">http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/rfe-spam-non-ebay-sale.html</A></P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[There is a scam going on right now.  19 sellers,(as of today) most long time members, many sold items.  I replied to the first one I saw.  I wanted a marine radar set.  Just like the above, the same thing happened.  I replied to their address and a price of a new unit for a give away price from Europe.  Send $400 by western Union.  Another clue, misuse of english terminolgy.  I bid on one seller, not going thru their instructions. Just a small bid.  I kept getting out bid instantly.
A time latter I was notified by ebay(trust & safety that my bid was cancelled and told that the sellers account has been compromised by another party.  I have  reported each seller an the appeared, as scams.  All these sellers had many other items for sale, and the same thing happen, clicking on any items.  
all sales were 24 hr deals.  How can ebay allow this to be repeated and repeated. 
How many people can you rip off in 24 hrs.?????]]></content>

Hence why they rely on us to report them, via the links I posted above.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>*** UPDATE 8/9/2005 - Google launched this service about a month ago and I've been serving videos since.&nbsp; It's VERY cool, but requires you to download a browser plugin.</P>
<P>Google is about to launch a new Video service.&nbsp; From what I gather, it will do two things.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The first is unlimited storage/hosting of your video!&nbsp; I've uploaded about 890MB and they haven't even batted an eye.&nbsp; No longer will you have to upload your video to a server somewhere to be hosted 'cause Google seems to be solving that issue (i.e. home videos?).</P>
<P>The other thing is indexing META data for searching.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Google's Videos, this information are things such as Title, Description, Language, Production company, Genre, dates, credits, etc.&nbsp; It also allows someone to upload a Transcript of the video!&nbsp; All of this information is indexed in Google's massive search library.&nbsp; </P>
<P>It also allows you to charge for access.&nbsp; I'm not sure how that will work, but it's there.</P>
<P>Here's the link that will be soon heard around the world: </P>
<P><A href="http://video.google.com/">http://video.google.com/</A></P>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>I've seen this before but haven't really gone back out to find an updated file to use since I've formatted a few times over the years.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There is a file on your machine called a "hosts" file.&nbsp; We use this a lot for programming websites.&nbsp; Well, you can use this file to block the majority of Spyware and PopUps that come up on your browser.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I know i know, "I already have a popup blocker".&nbsp; Yep, but do you have a "Ads" blocker?&nbsp; Blocking those annoying Flash and/or animated ads from annoying the hell out of you?&nbsp; This is what this file does.</P>
<P>I went out and found a fellow by the name of Mike that has been keeping an up-to-date file that you can download.&nbsp; Mike explains it best on his site:</P>
<P><A href="http://everythingisnt.com/hosts.html">http://everythingisnt.com/hosts.html</A></P>
<P>You can also just download the file manually here:</P>
<P><A href="http://everythingisnt.com/hosts">http://everythingisnt.com/hosts</A>&nbsp;(best to right-click and save as).&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you don't know what to do with this file, resort to the first link above.</P>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p>Today I wanted to get more friendly with RSS feeds from my friends and family.&nbsp; What is RSS?&nbsp; RSS are data (news) feeds from websites that have those XML and/or RSS buttons.&nbsp; It&#39;s a way for you to subscribe to a webpage/blog/gallery and get updates.</p><p>There are several (likes dozens and dozens) of stand-alone RSS Readers out there.&nbsp; And plugins for applications.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">www.newsgator.com</a> seems to be the most popular one, as it houses all of your feeds into one website you can login remotely and read.</p><p>Say you want to subscribe to my blog, but&nbsp;you don&#39;t want to hear about my computer or automotive exploits.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just want to subscribe to my Friend&#39;s and Family news/posts.&nbsp; Look at the Categories section here in my Blog.&nbsp; Notice the little (rss) next to it?&nbsp; :)&nbsp; You can subscribe to just certain Categories if you wish.&nbsp; All CommunityServer websites have this option.&nbsp; </p><p>Not ever having the time (or thought) over the last year or so, I tried the following three plugins for Outlook today:</p><p>BlogBot - <a href="http://www.blogbot.com/out/">http://www.blogbot.com/out/</a> <br />Attensa - <a href="http://www.attensa.com/">http://www.attensa.com/</a><br />RSS Popper - <a href="http://rsspopper.blogspot.com/">http://rsspopper.blogspot.com/</a></p><p>[GeekAlert]<br />I don&#39;t like how Attensa (and I think BlogBot)&nbsp;runs background apps.&nbsp; I guess this is for DDE for those apps?</p><p>Well, RSS Popper gets away without a background app.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; I just rightclick any XML button/link in IE and click &quot;Add to RSS Popper&quot;.&nbsp; Bam, it&#39;s added to my Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a very low overhead.&nbsp; RSS Popper is also open-source (well, as soon as the guy figures how where to host it), as well as being .NET.&nbsp; Those are all pluses in my book as I have some ideas to extend RSS Popper (create an XSL file for these emails for some default formatting right now).</p><p>Tip: If you are connecting to an Exchange server, you might want to create a seperate PST (Personal Folder file) and configure RSS Popper to write to it.&nbsp; This way you won&#39;t fill up your Exchange account, and there has been issues with Attensa&#39;s plugin for Outlook for such things.&nbsp; I can&#39;t say about RSS Popper as I do not use my Exchange inbox (deliver everything locally for now, on my raid drives).<br />[/GeekAlert]</p><p>RSS Popper gets my vote.&nbsp; </p><p>So if you want to subscribe to my blog here, first install RSS Popper.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;look for the &quot;RSS 2.0&quot; or &quot;Atom&quot; links at the bottom left of my blog.&nbsp; Right-click on the link and click &quot;Add to RSS Popper&quot;.&nbsp; You&#39;re done and will get updates to your Outlook.&nbsp; :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content>

<P>(let's see if I can interrupt/remember this properly, it's late and I've been working all day)<BR>Gas prices are priced similar to Supply and Demand.&nbsp; Well, our supply is much lower now (and getting even lower).&nbsp; We still have a supply&nbsp;but&nbsp;the supply <EM>is</EM> ~20% less (or was that 40%?).&nbsp; If our supply is less,&nbsp;our demand MUST be less (lowered).&nbsp; How do you&nbsp;lower the demand?&nbsp; Raise the prices&nbsp;to a point&nbsp;so only necessary people/trips are using gasoline.&nbsp; If there's not enough supply, raise it even higher.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>This deters people from driving just 2 miles to their local grocery store (they can walk).&nbsp; This deters the teenagers driving on the "strip" Friday and Saturday nights.&nbsp; This deters just about any unnecessary driving all together.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I hate it as much as you guys, but&nbsp;they are&nbsp;right.&nbsp; We've got such a high demand for fuel that it's starting to kick us in the ass.<o:p></o:p></P>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Last Saturday while playing coed flag-football for a sports league here in&nbsp;Nashville I felt a sharp pain in my left hamstring.&nbsp; I tend to have&nbsp;a high threshold for a little pain, so I kept on playing nursing my left leg (jumping off of my right now).&nbsp; Well,&nbsp;after a&nbsp;complicated reverse to get a tackle caused another such pain to go through my right hamstring.</P>
<P>Thinking I could stretch them out, I sidelined myself and stretched a bit.&nbsp; Was a bit sore, but got back into the game.&nbsp; </P>
<P>We won 41 to 0 (a shutout).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Limping around we took the other team out for a few beers to calm the soreness.&nbsp; I got home, but was still in pain.&nbsp; I laid around resting for the night.&nbsp; Sunday I awoke to some horrible pain.&nbsp; "This can't be good", I thought.&nbsp; Limped in to see&nbsp;the PTs at the YMCA Monday and they assure me it's nothing torn, just a sever pull in both hamstrings.</P>
<P>Today after the current round of heat-n-stretching excersises, I noticed a little bruising-like colors on the back of one leg.&nbsp; After I was done witht he stretching I examed them in the mirror.&nbsp; OUCH.&nbsp; It's like someone took a baseball bat to the back of my legs!&nbsp; </P>
<P>I don't think I'll be playing this Saturday.&nbsp;<IMG src="/emoticons/emotion-9.gif"></P>]]></content>

  <![CDATA[<P><STRONG>UPDATE:</STRONG> Riley was the winner&nbsp;with his calcuated guess of $889.23.&nbsp; The correct answer was $851.51.</P>
<P>So I have this old Bud Light coin jar I got as a house warming present from a friend when I moved to Atlanta back in March of 1997.&nbsp; I had a rule (briefly) that when people visited, they must keep the Coin Jar Gods happy and contribute their loose change upon arriving (like I said, didn't last long).</P>
<P><IMG alt="Coin Jar" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/storage/1000.4.194.oc260000.jpg"></P>
<P>It's been about 8.5 years since I started this, and yesterday I decided it was too full (you couldn't fit another penny in it).&nbsp; I took it by the bank yesterday and they are cashing it for me.&nbsp; I'll know Friday how much it held.</P>
<P>So does anyone want to take a guess?&nbsp; </P>
<P>I'll go first.&nbsp; Based on the amount of coin I started this jar with, I'm going to take a conservative guess and say $1,633.81.</P>
<P><STRONG>Get it cashed, for free!</STRONG><BR>Oh on&nbsp;a side note, do not take your change to Kroger or use those automated "cashing" machines.&nbsp; They charge an arm and a leg.&nbsp; Instead, go by your bank and ask for "Coin Bags". These are specially re-enforced and sealable coin bags you can fill up.&nbsp; They will take 'em, sort 'em, count 'em, and deposite&nbsp;'em into your account - for free!</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[If the piggybank were a perfect cylinder, it's volume would be pi*r^2*h, or 3.14*(3.5")^2*23" = 884.7 cubic inches.

This volume is too big, however, because the piggybank tapers and forms a neck. The neck appears to be about 1/3 the bank's height, so I will estimate the volume of the piggybank to be (3.14*(3.5")^2*15.3") + 3/4 * (3.14*(3.5")^2*7.7") = 810.6 cubic inches.

It is difficult to know exactly how much money fits within a cubic inch, but I measure on a standard ruler that at max, 8 quarters can fit in a 1"x1"x1" space.

The other coins are smaller, so I am going to allow 1.8 dimes, 1.2 nickels, 1.5 pennies as rough estimates for the number of repective coins that take up the same space amount of space as a quarter. (These are the closest measurement comparisons I can obtain for the size differences between different coins.)

Our maximum value, then for a cubic inch is $2 (8 quarters) and our minimum value for a cubic inch is 12 cents (12 pennies). That's an average of $1.06 per cubic inch relying completely on the size of the coins.

I believe this number ($1.06 per cubic inch) is a little inaccurate, however, because it assumes that the piggybank contains an equal number of each coin type, which will certainly not be the case. On any given transaction, a person will rarely (or never) receive more than 3 quarters, more than 2 dimes, more than 1 nickel, or more than 4 pennies.

A buyer will not receive the maximum allowed number of a certain coin type on every transaction, so we can't assume that the ratio of quarters to dimes to nickels to pennies will be an exact 3:2:1:4, but we CAN assume that the piggybank will contain more pennies than quarters, more quarters than dimes, and more dimes than nickels. 

Assuming that change for transactions result in an equally distibuted range from 1 cent to 99 cents (a fair assumption), a proper ratio of coins to each other can be determined by figuring out exactly how many of each coin a cashier would need after making 99 transactions where each transaction amount (1 to 99 cents) was represented exactly once:

For the above experiment:

150 quarters are needed (1 for each transaction between 25 and 49 cents, 2 for each transaction between 50 and 74 cents, and 3 for each transaction between 75 and 99 cents; 1*25 + 2*25 + 3*25 = 150),

80 dimes are are needed (1 for each transaction between the ranges 10 to 19, 35 to 44, 60 to 69, and 85 to 94 and 2 for each transaction between the ranges 20 to 24, 45 to 49, 70 to 74, and 95 to 99; 4*10 + 2*5*4 = 80),

40 nickels are needed (1 for each transaction between 5 to 9, 15 to 19, ..., 95 to 99; 10*4 = 40),

and 200 pennies are needed (1 penny for every number that ends in 1 or 6, 2 pennies for every number that ends in 2 or 7, 3 pennies for every number that ends in 3 or 8, and 4 pennies for every number that ends in 4 or 9; 1*20 + 2*20 + 3*20 + 4* 20 = 400).

In summary a cashier needs 150 quarters, 80 dimes, 40 nickels, and 200 pennies for every transaction from 1 to 99 cents. This equates to a 15:8:4:20 ratio of quarters to dimes to nickels to pennies, meaning that every random handful of $4.95 in change can be expected to consist of 15 quarters, 8 dimes, 4 nickels, and 20 pennies.

From my numbers earlier (8 quarters per cubic inch, etc.), 15 quarters can fit into 1.875 cubic inches, 8 dimes can fit into .555 cubic inches, 4 nickels can fit into .416 cubic inches, and 20 pennies can fit into 1.666 cubic inches. Therefore, $4.95 should on average take up 4.512 cubic inches, which correlates to $1.097 per cubic inch (almost 3 cents higher than the original $1.06 per cubic inch).

So, assuming 810.6 cubic inches is a good guess for the volume of the piggybank (maybe Eric will post more measurements concerning the height and radius of the neck at different points), my estimated guess is $1.097 * 810.6 = $889.23]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[My Guess:  $620.64 & a bag of chips.

I made a rough guess that the bottom 15" was a cylinder, and the top 8" had half the volumne of a cylinder. Then I calculated the volumn of each section, and used the height and radius of a penny, nickel, dime, and quarter to approx how many would fit into that volumne with a non-perfect stacking method (I assumed each coin was a square to account for the inevitible gaps between coins, and that there were no 50 cent or dollar coins.

That gave me these totals per coin type:
Quarter: $1,130
Dime: $1,074
Nickel: $265
Penny:  $128.3

I had intially used a simple 1:2:3:4 ratio between the coins, but after just reading Riley's post I like his 15:8:4:20 ratio better and recalced with that.

So it gives me $620.64 total. Seems kind of low, but I'll low ball you. =)

I know this blog is old, but came across it when I was looking to guess the same thing with a 5 gallon jug I'd been saving in for about 10-12 years.  I used Riley's formula and figured out the jar was ~1155 Cubic inches * 1.097 = $1,267.04.  Cashed it in today and it was $1,311.37 not including a few pesos that got dropped in there, so his calculations are pretty close.  I originally thought it was about $600, so it looks like I'm getting a bigger flat screen.  ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Cindy: Well, using Riley's formula (that actually won), he calculated that in a space of 1 x 1 x 1 inch (1 cubic inch or cu.in.), you can fit 8 quarters.  Now in that same space, he assumes 1.8x the number of dimes can occupy the same space.  So, that is:

8 x 1.8 = 14.4 dimes in 1cu.in. space.

That comes to a total of $1.44 per 1 cubic inch.

He roughly calculated the volume of the jar to be 810.6cu.in.  So, the final answer would be:

$1.44 * 810.6 = $1,167.26

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>I just found the coolest little download from Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;A free download to mount ISO files as drive letters (think MAC here).</P>
<P><A href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe">Virtual CD-ROM Control Panel for Windows XP</A></P>
<P>Now THIS needs to be included in Vista, if it is not already.&nbsp; As the source of where I found it said, it's a little bit of a manual process and it's UnSupproted by MS (use at your own risk).&nbsp; It's got an ugly interface, but for Vista it should be a built-in right-click.</P>
<P>But we all know how slow VirtualPC is to install an OS from a CDROM.&nbsp; Using this tool I was able to load up W2K3 Server very quickly.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Tip: When running the virtual PC, make sure to go to CD -&gt; Use Physical Drive Z to enable the ISO to boot from.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Very very nice...</P>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[BlueTooth - Making life too simple for everyone]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Let me put this into perspective.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You can:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Answer cell calls with&nbsp;a BlueTooth headset. 
<LI>Answer office phone calls with&nbsp;the same&nbsp;BlueTooth headset. 
<LI>Talk in&nbsp;PC Video Conferences with the same BlueTooth headset. 
<LI>Talk with VOIP for things such as Gamers and Vonage, using the same BlueTooth headset. 
<LI>With a laptop, connect to the Internet via 256+Kbps DUN anywhere that has SprintPCS coverage (i.e. on road trips or no WiFi hotspots, &lt; 2s to connect). 
<LI>Newer Sprint phones are&nbsp;suppose to support up to 1.2Mbps download rate (like the one mentioned below). 
<LI>Especially with Sprints Nights @ 7pm, it's <STRONG><U><EM>free</EM></U></STRONG> all night&nbsp;and weekend long.</LI></UL>
<P>With three devices:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="http://www1.sprintpcs.com/media/Assets/ueContent/phones/whoa-phoneDetailsSPHA940LSS.gif" target=_blank>Sprint MM-A940 2.0 Megapixel cell phone </A>(or any BlueTooth cell, just sprint provides faster data xfer) 
<LI><A href="http://www.headsets.com/headsets/wireless/plantronics/510s/description.html" target=_blank>Plantronics Voyager 510S BlueTooth System for Desktop </A>(DON'T BUY FROM THAT LINK!&nbsp; Search the net, much cheaper versions).&nbsp; If you don't want the Office Phone functionallity, get just the headset for $60) 
<LI>BlueTooth-enabled Laptop supporting DUN and&nbsp;Audio/Voice BlueTooth profiles (or a $50 USB adapter if it doesn't)</LI></UL>
<P>And you can do this&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>without removing the cell phone from your belt or pocket</STRONG></EM>, or lifting your handset on your office phone.&nbsp; That's just too cool.&nbsp; Just imagine, riding along on a road trip or in the car pool to work in the morning.&nbsp; Flip open the laptop and connect to the Internet, without removing the phone from your belt clip.</P>
<P>I've spent a long time researching these devices, and finally the day has come.&nbsp; They are on order.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now if I can just get them all to work...&nbsp; </P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[You are about to discover that all BT profiles are not created equal.

The drivers and handshaking do not work the same with every device.

It will be difficult when you have multiple BT devices and the headset does not know which device to pair with. That is the real problem right now.

I get plenty of static on my headsets as well so these headsets sound no better than most cordless phones.

Plus you look like a dweeb with these things on all day.]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[BlueTooth Expedition - The Right Stuff]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned recently how I&#39;m going all BlueTooth for most of my communications.&nbsp; </p><p>All I got to say is, wow!&nbsp; It&#39;s gone beyond my expectations of BlueTooth.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure if I had a PDA Cell Phone it would be even more, but with my current cell I no longer have to wait for Sprint to transfer my numbers from one phone to another (my phone is too new, they can&#39;t xfer my numbers yet).&nbsp; I just did it via BlueTooth from my Outlook.</p><p>And the built-in TransFlash card in my cell phone?&nbsp; I can access it just like another&nbsp;flash card&nbsp;(once I connect the phone) with the card IN the phone!&nbsp; I can drag and drop MP3s onto my flash card (within the phone) and BAM&nbsp;- I got a new RingTone.&nbsp; All without removing any cards, putting into readers, etc.</p><p>And we haven&#39;t even gotten to the Headset features.&nbsp; Yep, it acts just like another Sound Card in your system.&nbsp; I&#39;ve already configured MSN Messenger and TeamSpeak (VoIP tool for gamers) to use my headset.&nbsp; Just as easy as picking &quot;PLT BT 510&quot; sound card instead of &quot;Logitech USB Headset&quot; sound card (which I got from my SOCOM I game :) ).</p><p>You just have to make sure you select the right components.&nbsp; The following post outlines those details.</p><p>What&#39;s most amazing is&nbsp;the headset is now connected to three devices:</p><ul><li>Cell Phone </li><li>Computer </li><li>Plantronics&#39; Deskphone Base Stand (that came with the headset, allows use of Office Phones with the headset)</li></ul><p>Once I connect the phone and computer to the headset, how do I switch?&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple.&nbsp; Each one that connects has X number of beeps when they connect based on the order of the connections.&nbsp; So if we follow the order above, I have:</p><ul><li>1 beep for Cell </li><li>2 beeps for Computer&#39;s bluetooth </li><li>3 beeps for DeskPhone base</li></ul><p>When a call or computer or something wants use of the headset, it beeps X number of times.&nbsp; I just have to reach up and press the tiny button on the headset those number of times to connect.&nbsp; Or vice versa!&nbsp; I can press the button on the headset 3 times, and it will pickup the Base station.&nbsp; I can press it once, and my Cell Phone asks me (through the headset) what my Voice Command is (Name Dial, Randall Greer, Home) and it dials. </p><p>This is just tool cool, and slick.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now this wasn&#39;t without a hitch.&nbsp; Two actually.&nbsp; </p><p>First hitch being you have to make sure your BlueTooth devices (Cell, Headset, builtin BlueTooth in laptop or USB/PCMCIA version, etc) all support the &quot;BlueTooth Profiles&quot; you want.&nbsp; Refer to the picture below for a list of currently known Profiles (yeah, a LOT).&nbsp; </p><p><img height="430" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/bluetooth_profile_stack.gif" width="550" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, there are two Belkin BlueTooth adapters for computers (I just went with Belkin as that&#39;s what Alienware was informing me about, there are other products but I am unfimilar with them). The F8T006 (PCMCIA) and the F8T001 (USB). I went with the USB version.</p><p align="left">The difference in the two besides PCMCIA vs USB?&nbsp; A big one.&nbsp; The USB version supports many more BlueTooth profiles then the PCMCIA version including&nbsp;Hands-Free&nbsp;and Headset&nbsp;Profiles - the two that the BlueTooth headset need to connect to a device!&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m glad I called their tech support before purchasing, cause I was about to buy the PCMCIA version.&nbsp;</p><p align="left"><img align="right" height="325" src="http://www1.sprintpcs.com/media/Assets/ueContent/phones/whoa-phoneDetailsSPHA940LSS.gif" width="354" />The same goes for any BlueTooth cell phone and headset.&nbsp;&nbsp;The older&nbsp;Blackberry&nbsp;Bluetooth versions don&#39;t support&nbsp;File&nbsp;Transfer Profile from what I read online (don&#39;t quote me on that), as well as the Treos (even though I&#39;ve heard about a flash you can get from Verizon to fix that).&nbsp; </p><p align="left">Also, not all BlueTooth headsets are made the same!&nbsp; The Plantronics 510 is the ONLY one that supports&nbsp;the Hands-Free Profile&nbsp;out of the Plantronics line of BT headsets (used to switch from device to device, to control the connection).&nbsp; I just liked it cause of it&#39;s small size.&nbsp; Little did I know it was luck that I picked the right one.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">So just make sure to do your research before you buy&nbsp;your BlueTooth devices.&nbsp; </p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">The other hitch (yeah, that was just ONE above) is Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2 comes with its own BlueTooth Profile controller.</p><p align="left">[geek alert] I haven&#39;t had any experience with previous versions of BlueTooth drivers on XP before now.&nbsp; But when I was trying to get all of my devices connected, it was a no go.&nbsp; The drivers on the computer wouldn&#39;t see all of the profiles of the phone or headset.&nbsp; I was very disappointed last night,&nbsp;until this morning.&nbsp; I called up Belkin&#39;s support to ask them why and they walked me through manually installing XP&#39;s driver for the Belkin BlueTooth Device in my Device Manager.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t think there was any problems as it listed two (Microsoft BlueTooth Emulator and Belkin BlueTooth Device).&nbsp; But little did I know I had to force the Belkin BlueTooth Device to use the same driver as the Microsft BlueTooth Emulator, which forced the Emulator to disappear.&nbsp; I would have never have guessed that one.&nbsp; And that&#39;s one that most people will not know.</p><p align="left">So if you do get the Belkin USB adapter pictured above, like I did, drop me a line and I&#39;ll walk you through it.&nbsp; Or call their TS, they seemed to know exactly the issue.[/geek aleart]</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi Eric - thanks for the great post.  I recently purchased the Voyager 510 headset as well and was looking to use it in a simlar scenario as yours.  However, I'm having trouble switching from cell phone to PC to base station.  When i called Platronics, they said that only 2 devices (total) were supported and that if I tried to pair a third, the headset would only remember the last two that were connected.  So, if I use the headset with skype on my PC, I then have trouble getting it connected to my cell phone.  I seem to be able to keep the connection with the bast station all the time, but I haven't tried that many scenarios yet.  Can you offer any advice for me?  ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Very odd.  I do not have that problem.  Well, it does disconnect from my cell phone when I connect it to the PC.  So yes, the limit of two connections at once makes sense.  But that's never a problem for me.  After I am done using it with my PC, I just click Connect again on my cell and it reconnects to the headset.  Or, just unplug the power to the base station so your cell stays connected while u are on your computer.  That damn base station wants to stay connected no matter what.

Just this weekend, I did the following without "Pairing":

Friday - Headset on base station, cell phone rang.  Picked up the headset and it picked up/answered my cell phone.  Later in the day, i get a call on the office phone.  I pick up the headset and the base station picks up this time (I like how the base station defers to the cell when a call comes in, instead of pickin gupi the base station).  

Friday afternoon, I plugged in my BlueTooth USB adapter listed above and connected to my headset (right-clicked the bluetooth icon and clicked "Connect" to my headset. it connected and beeped in my ear).  I then opened TeamSpeak (an online voice-comm gaming app) and set it to the BlueTooth Audio sound card my headset created, and was online gaming with the headset.

That's three devices without pairing.

Skype SHOULD work the same way with a BlueTooth Audio sound card created when the headset connects.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Shouldn't have to.  That's the default operation.  

All sound goes through pc speakers, including any voice, game, and music that you have.  And any input comes from your MIC input.

What I describe above is for advance users that want to seperate voice from their PC Speakers.  I.e. a dedicated headset.]]></content>

<P><EM><SPAN class=boldBlueLarge><B>"WHAT IS TENNESSEE ONLINE TRAFFIC SCHOOL? </B></SPAN><BR>Traffic school in Franklin Tennessee can be completed online in the comfort of your home. If you need to take defensive driving for an Franklin Tennessee traffic ticket sign up for Driving University online, pay online, do the course online. Defensive driving school for traffic tickets, insurance discounts or for new drivers is simple and convenient at Driving University. The Franklin Tennessee defensive driving school is self paced and some drivers will start and finish the course in one sitting or some log in and out as their schedule allows them to. "</EM></P>
<P>To me this sounds too easy.&nbsp; Take some quizes online, you're done.&nbsp; The fact that I can not find any other information about this site via Google tells me they are either new, or not endorced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other facts as they support all Counties and States, I just can't see certain coruts (*cough* the 'boro) allowing online driving school.&nbsp; And another fact that they seem to be using the same Template for Counties and Cities makes it seem fishy.</P>
<P>Yeah, I'm paranoid about anything like this.</P>
<P>What do you guys think?&nbsp; I briefly had a thought to do this, but came to my senses.&nbsp; I wonder how many others they trick.</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I was assigned a driving school by the court; I gave them a call and asked if they knew anything about an online course or drivinguniversity.com.  The woman replied that it might be legal in some states, but that Tennessee did not nor had it ever had an online  testing program.

I'd imagine if it was legit, the court would have offered it to me straight up.

I think sitting thru the boring class is the punishment they're after, however.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey, I've learned lots of little tid bits from the dozen+ (yeah, more then 12!) I've sat through.  Little things that really help, like the new way of properly aligning your mirrors (I was using the old-school way my father taught me).  The new way pretty much eliminates blind spots, and just last week I almost changed lanes into someone - but saw them in the mirror with the new angle.  Perfect!  

If you are in Franklin, make sure to lookup the Factory of Franklin's training course.  You get free drinks, free food and snacks, AND it's one of the only National Certified courses, meaning it's accepted in any state/county (i.e. you got a ticket in FL, and live near Franklin).

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Eric- you're completely right.  There are a lot of misleading online defensive driving on traffic school programs out there.  These companies offer all states and all counties, when in reality there are only 20 or so states that will actually allow online defensive driving.  When a customer calls to complain, these companies offer no refund and refer to very small print hiddne in their site use policy.  Scammers...

My school, www.DefensiveDrivinginNewJersey.com is only approved for use in New Jersey right now, but as I look at other states and competitors, it makes me feel like their business practices may taint the online delivery or defensive driving / traffic school altogether!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[It is nice to hear from a real person of these online traffic schools.  It eases my mind that there are some legit schools out there, and I will make of it (if I am ever in Jersey, currently in NYC - oh, so close!).

Thank you for taking the time to respond to the question of rather these were legit.  It would appear the scammers are in full swing in your industry, so I would suggest brokering a deal with NJ to provide a list of actual "certified" online driving schools, and have you listed.  Start by going to your city counsil (for local), and then into the governor office.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[A local sms in Singapore cost 5 cents each (US$0.029). An international sms cost 15cents (US$0.089)each.

Most $30 mobile plans comes with at least 300 free sms and an extra 100 sms if you choose to pay direct debit from your bank account. 

Our mobile phones are not locked to any particular operator/networks. Plus when it comes to making international calls, we have a choice between the old school premium or VOIP numbers too.

My jaw nearly drop when Cingular told me that it cost US$0.99 p/min to call SG excluding normal talk time. Here in SG, if I use the VOIP line (http://www.starhub.com/mobile/promotionsandevents/free_idd018.html), I can make free calls to the US! I only need to pay for local call charge.

The US telco market is amazing! It is so anti-competitive and so much margins to be made. Then again, it's a really big market maybe they need such margins to cover their costs.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>This past weekend, Telligent held a contest with internal developers to see who could generate the best CSModule.&nbsp; There were about 20 submissions - none from me.&nbsp; I was too busy working all weekend.&nbsp; Next time though, I'll win the Gold.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P><A href="http://developer.communityserver.org/default.aspx/CS.FirstCSModuleContent">http://developer.communityserver.org/default.aspx/CS.FirstCSModuleContent</A></P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[We follow the Christian calender. Recent studies have shown that due to the mathematical errors made in the calender when it was first created, we are in fact 5 years behind the year we should be in.

In which case, we shouldn't be in the year 2006. We SHOULD be in the year 2011.

Therefore, the triple six should have occurred on June the sixth of 2001.

The triple six of 1906 should have occurred on June the sixth 1901.

Therefore, due to the fact that we are already messed up with the current calender as is, the actual triple six is long since past, is it not? ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Actually, Arvest Bank is not WalMart.  This is a mis-statement.

Arvest Bank was founded by relatives of Sam Walton, who originally founded WalMart.  This is why Arvest Bank is closely related to WalMart.  But it isn't WalMart.  I'm sure Arvest Bank owns a number of shares of WalMart (or vice versa).  But that's the closes extent of their relationship.

WalMart has applied to the FDIC for the rights of federal banking.  Right now all WalMart is approved to do is cash checks. 

Again, the main reason for applying to the FDIC is to get around the CC transaction fees by allowing WalMart to have their own Credit Cards and process transactions all in-house.]]></content>

      <content type="text">
        <![CDATA[<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 110px" border=0 align=left src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/storage/1000.4.788.1003_bigwheels7_m3.jpg" width=200 height=110>Comedy Central joins an ever growing list of TV and Newspapers&nbsp;censoring the image of the Prophet Mohamed.</P>
<P>Last week South Park&nbsp;started a two-part episode spoofing the Family Guy sitcom (<A href="http://eduncan911.com/funsies/southpark-_2f00_-profit-mohamed_3f00_.html" mce_href="/blogs/eduncan911/archive/2006/04/06/571.aspx">read previous post</A>)&nbsp;titled <EM>First Amendment</EM>.&nbsp; It was making fun of Fox refusing to show the Prophet.&nbsp; Within the first episode, the SouthPark creators dared Comedy Central to allow SP to&nbsp;allow the Prophet Mohamed to be shown in Episode Two this week.&nbsp; I'm sure there was a lot of talk around the conference rooms there.</P>
<P>In Episode two, aired Wednesday at 10 PM EST, they attempted to show the Prophet.&nbsp; But they cut the footage, saying <EM>"Comedy Central has refused to show the Prophet"</EM>.&nbsp; But yet, they still had the "Voice" on there.&nbsp; </P>
<P>South Park has crossed a number of ethnic and racial lines, but there's always a moral the creators try to convey which seems to get lost by most (of not all) anti-South Park people.</P>
<P>The one for this episode was that if we are forced to use censorship, then the terrorist have won.&nbsp; As where does censorship stop?&nbsp; Free Speech entitles oneself a free voice.&nbsp; Given Comedy Central is FCC monitored, the FCC has not banned the image of Prophet Mohamed.&nbsp; It was Comedy Central itself that refused&nbsp;to show it (scarred?).</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>
<P>Eric Cartman: <EM><STRONG>"If you hate a TV show, all you have to do is to get an episode pulled.&nbsp; Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air. ...so my plan is to use this whole Mohamed thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show [of Family Guy].</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>I'm going to use fear to get them to do what&nbsp;I want."</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>Bart Simpson's spoofed character: <EM><STRONG>"Isn't that like Terrorism?"</STRONG></EM></P>
<P>Eric Cartman: <STRONG><EM>"No.&nbsp; It isn't like Terrorism.&nbsp; It</EM>&nbsp;IS&nbsp;<EM>Terrorism."</EM></STRONG></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We all are given the right to Free Speech by the constitution of the United States of America.&nbsp; Giving-in to Terrorist threatening violence is the same as giving into demands when they kidnap hostages: it lets the terrorist know they can get their way.</P>
<P>Would I censor image from my website if you posted&nbsp;the cartoon&nbsp;in a comment?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But I myself respect other religions and beliefs: which I know showing the image would be greatly disrespectful.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I wanted to thwart the powers-at-be and go against the “man” to make a crude statement (like I would have in my teens), I would have posted it here.</P>
<P>I have been a big South Park fan since episode one due to their true-to-Earth viewpoints, cunning storylines and willing to say the things we are thinking, on the tube – daring all others.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And I will remain a South Park fan.</P>
<P>People I have met that are against South Park tell me what offended them.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>When talking to these people, out of the 10 seasons (yes, 10!), all of these complaints and boycotts of South Park all have one thing in common: The focus on the graphic, grotesque nature of the cartoons and speech.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P>If you walk up to me and say, <EM>“Eric, I can’t believe you are a South Park fan.”</EM>&nbsp; Then I would state the obvious, <EM>“You didn't like the movie Fight Club, Secret Window, and other movies with an alternative plot behind the obvious storyline,&nbsp;did you?”</EM><SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>South Park on the surface can look highly offensive (to those offended).<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But there’s always an underlining moral if you look close enough.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Over the last two weeks, it was Censorship and how the Prophet Mohamed cartoon issue has&nbsp;taken away&nbsp;our right to Free Speech in America.&nbsp; Or at least, scarred network tv into censorship.</P>
<P>So I say no to censorship.&nbsp; Show the image if you wish.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And I will not judge you any differently.&nbsp; </P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Had the FCC pulled the show, you'd have a case, but I don't think the constitution protects free speech in a private enterprise. For instance, I could attempt to post all kinds of rude stuff here on CS and I have no doubt it would be removed. That is not censorship! Just like Comedy Central, CS has a right to decide what gets/stays on the air.

Sometimes, rude is just rude, even in cartoons with an alledged message. ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[John almost has it right.  It is true there is no constitutional prohibition against Comedy Central deciding what it plays on its channel.  Since Comedy Central only receives its licenses through the FCC licensing review/renewal process, the government has essentially censored the entire airwaves.  

I am prohibited from starting my own TV station and broadcasting direct distribution without the approval of the FCC.  And surely they won't allow me to launch my own satellite and broadcast my own media.  Doing so would give me a private enterprise that I rightly self censor.

The government prohibits free speech on the airwaves with "no law…abriding the freedom of speech".  The airwaves are intangible, unlike the press which are the tangible transmission of ideas, therefore broadcast media is speech.

Since Comedy Central is permitted to broadcast because of tightly regulated oversight by the FCC and there is no freedom for alternatives, according to our principals of government, TV Channels are just extension of the government, and they are never taking a principled stand not broadcasting a show.  

There are cases where they might restrict a show because of their image, etc with advertisers, but I think we can all agree that South Park fans are not the most “sensitive” people and showing the prophet was not going to turn any of them away from the show…]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>I don't think we should respect everyone's beliefs. I think that we will soon be at war with the Muslims themselves, because they follow a hateful ideology and are bent on world domination. I think a comparison to the Nazis is reasonable. Would we tolerate Nazis, even the "moderate" ones, if we were at war with Germany? I don't imagine so. We should not be afraid to openly criticize Islam, not just for its contempt for free speech, but for its anti-semetism, its treatment of women, and its inherent violent nature. We may soon have to choose between a medieval world, and a free one--let's not start by being timid. </P>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Pardon me, but that's a lot of bullcrap you let out there Stanley. The Islam has nothing in common' with the Nazi ideology and obviously you are not at war with the Islam itself - of course one should not be afraid of criticizing other beliefs, but there's a huge difference between sound criticism and plain mockery.
Religions are constructs to provide moral conceptsWhile they stone thugs to death in public and values - sure they are not the best fundament to build on as they usually are founded on some silly fairy tales with pseudohistorical background but for people who are not able to make sense of anything in their life without havin' a religious backing they sure are better than droppin' into some sort of valueless existence - see also böckenförle dilemma. 
There is no general religious enemy upon this earth and especially not among abrahamic religions like christianism, islam and judaism.

I think it was a good idea that they didnt show Profit in the comedy South Park because it would be disrespectful to islam. I do not think that we should criticize any ones religion. People use religion to create trouble in the world. If every muslim was actually following islam there would be nothing bad to say about muslims. We should all learn more about different religions and not let TV educate us.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[All I can say is that we have to respect others religious views.  It's about respect. We are living in a very ME world. It is a very sensitive subject to a believer when you make fun of or put our God (Jesus (JC)....your new show you think is so funny) or their prophet (for Muslims) in a sick and blasphemous image.  It is wrong no matter which way you look at it.  This is a sad day for all of us when people think this is funny.  You mock my Lord now but you will meet your maker one day and trust me on this... EVERY knee will bow and He will say to you "I never knew you".  Your money and fame will be gone and your time here on earth will be a mist in the wind compared to eternity.  The difference between a True Bible believing Christian and a Muslim is that we won't threaten you with death, we will pray for you.  That's why you cowards will continue to air your disgusting new show JC.  Enjoy your fame while you can. But when your life becomes empty and senseless, filled with heartache...don't wonder why...remember what you did.]]></content>

<P>17.8 MPG vs 24.1 MPG.&nbsp; Read on...<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I can not count the number of driving schools I've been to that got me out of a speeding ticket.&nbsp; I know I had 7 in Davidson Co. in <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nashville</st1:place></st1:City> alone, and I only lived there 6 years.&nbsp; Not to mention the countless counties I have received driving citations in across the country, and have driven back only to go to court and plea for driving school - which I get 19/20 times it seems.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I always learn something new with these schools too.&nbsp; I don't just sit back and wing it.&nbsp; I actually do read, as I learn some new habit all the time.&nbsp; Recently, it was the new way the government wants you to place your hands.&nbsp; No longer at 10 and 2, but at 8 and 4.&nbsp; This lowers the chances of you breaking your arms in an airbag going off, where at 10 and 2, you have a high chance of injury to your arms in rollovers and side impact collisions with your left arm being strung out the window.</P>
<P>I find myself quite proud to have an extremely thick "Driving Citations" folder in my filing cabinet at home, of which I always went to court and plead.&nbsp; Didn't matter if it was in KY, GA, or even a&nbsp;bonsai run all the way to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Florida</st1:place></st1:State>&nbsp;for court, sign the driving school plea, and drive back to TN at the&nbsp;time.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Why?&nbsp; My driving record has been clean for almost 8 years now and when you start to total up how much&nbsp;each one of those tickets would have cost me in my "Good Driver" discount at my insurance, not to mention running the risk of getting my license suspended, it makes sense of why I did that.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I cruise along the Dallas North Tollway at around 75 to 85 MPH - speed limit 55mph.&nbsp; Travel distance is about&nbsp;34 miles on the Tollway every day to and from work.&nbsp; Mostly try to stay in the center, but people just don't get over.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Do I tailgate?&nbsp; Very seldom, if not at all.&nbsp; Within these driving school&nbsp;courses I read and answer the side-bar quizzes like "Are you an aggressive driver?"&nbsp;- I answer no to tailgating often.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>There's also a question like, "Do you have to pass every car on the road?"&nbsp; I try to answer seldom, but I think back to my college days of where I was proud to count each car I pass, and how many passed me from my weekly commutes from <st1:City w:st="on">Chattanooga</st1:City> to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nashville</st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; I think the record was 180 something cars I passed -&nbsp;1 passed me.&nbsp; The <st1:City w:st="on">Nashville</st1:City> to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City> sprints are even more horrendous at 300+ cars passed, if I could keep count with booking at 130+ MPH quite often.&nbsp; Zero cars passing me.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>When moving to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Dallas</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">TX</st1:State></st1:place> I slowed down a bit.&nbsp; Cruising at 80 MPH or so.&nbsp; If a car comes up behind me with plenty of warning, sure I'll move over and let ya pass.&nbsp; If a car comes out of no where and tailgates my ass, I won't slow down or speed up.&nbsp; I'll just wait until I have room to get over, and will then move over.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I follow the Good Driver rules such as scanning your mirrors ever 10 seconds (especially the rearview)&nbsp;and be absolutely mindful of your entire surroundings, knowing where each car is in each lane next to you within 20'.&nbsp; This is just good driving habits and has saved me from countless near-collisions from someone being a jerk or an ass.&nbsp; Nothing should be taking you from concentrating on this, and it's what I do every second in the car.&nbsp; Cell phones?&nbsp; I hate my friends talking to me while driving.&nbsp; I do it with an ear piece, but I hate it when I do and usually try to pull over.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Road Rage.&nbsp; Who here hasn't had Road Rage?&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; Only once ever in my life, and I still don't know how I pissed off that guy.&nbsp; I had cruise on at 65mph into 55, in the right lane,&nbsp;was passing an 18 wheeler on the right and this guy drove through the right-emergency lane and threw a beer bottle into my convertible - an open beer bottle!&nbsp; Hitting my friend in the head, and spilling beer all over me.&nbsp; Short outcome, I let it go after 10 minutes of rage.&nbsp; Punk.&nbsp; I was 21 then.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>All other times drivers have gotten pissed at me for going a bit too fast?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; I find it actually humorous that they can't control their rage.&nbsp; I'll play the traffic smart, inching over one lane, passing a car slowly.&nbsp; And trapping them in traffic - which makes them even more mad.&nbsp; I've had a few yell at me and threaten me.&nbsp; I give them the "Hello.&nbsp; Have a nice day." smile and look, and exit the next ramp, to where they can't follow.&nbsp; Next.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I could keep going on about my habits, but I do consider myself a fairly safe driver - to others.&nbsp; If I am driving at 95mph, it is with no other vehicles around me.&nbsp; If I come up onto a car in the right lane, I slow to 80 or so, so not to scare them too much.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I know about being courteous, and try to as often as I can.&nbsp; Finding myself giving the right-away to far too many jerks here in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dallas</st1:place></st1:City>.&nbsp; But yet, I just sit back and ease back up to 80 or so on the Tollway.&nbsp; I'll let them get the ticket.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I've noticed <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dallas</st1:place></st1:City> drivers have a bad habit of what I like to call&nbsp;Pacing Syndrome.&nbsp; Doesn't bother me, but it pisses the guy off that's tailing-gating me because he can not get ahead.&nbsp; What is Pacing Syndrome?&nbsp; It's when two cars are pacing each other, in two different lanes,&nbsp; blocking others from passing.&nbsp; This is not intentional as it's usually&nbsp;this way far up the road ahead, with two cars all by themselves within a car length of each other.&nbsp; The one on the&nbsp;left just isn't aware enough of their surroundings at all.&nbsp; Nor are they aware that it's courteous to move over to the right, where you won't loose any speed, and pace the car in front of you.&nbsp; Instead, they are side by side.&nbsp; Sometimes even 3 wide.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>This becomes an issue with I'm cruising at 80 MPH, and slow smoothly down to 60 or so to where they are pacing - now I have a number of cars behind me beeping and flashing their lights.&nbsp; What am I suppose to do?&nbsp; I get over (I usually do!), and bam - now they move up to&nbsp;tailgate the car in the left lane - which sometimes pisses off the left-lane guy even more.&nbsp; And I've seen Road Rage ensure from this here in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dallas</st1:place></st1:City>.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Just be mindful of your surroundings, and please move over!<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.</P>
<P>There's another driving school lesson that I learned a long time ago, and 99% of people on the road need to learn.&nbsp; Road Rage is not only getting mad, but it's causing the others to get mad as well.&nbsp; Even though I found it funny when they got mad, I was myself entising even more rage from them.</P>
<P>A common example of this are the pricks that speed up to block someone from getting over.&nbsp; That, you all have to agree, is the single worse habit a driver could have.&nbsp; How many times have you been stuck by someone goofball speeding up, closing their gap for the car in front of you, to block you from getting over?</P>
<P>Now I am not talking those small 2-car length areas they close quickly.&nbsp; I'm talking to where you have your blinker on, in hopes they see you and let you over.&nbsp; Instead, they speed up.&nbsp; Entising Road Rage I'll admit, I usually just move on over anyhow.&nbsp; I need a new paint job of them rear-ending me if they do - but they will not.</P>
<P>Me?&nbsp; I never close the gap.&nbsp; Even if it's a prick darting in and out of traffic.&nbsp; "Why not?" you ask?&nbsp; Because it is not worth it.&nbsp; Now if they do slip in one of those small 2 car-length spaces I've left open (traffic), I do retaliate a bit.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; I keep the exact same distance they got when they squeezed in.&nbsp; I rationalize this by thinking, "Ok, if you think you had enough room to squeeze in, 6' from my bumper - I'll leave you 6' of room until you move back over up the road somewhere."</P>
<P>Yes, that's tailgating.&nbsp; But they thought they had enough room when then squeezed in right?&nbsp; So I leave them what they thought was adiquate.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I am not an aggressive driver.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Finally, two Mondays ago&nbsp;after hearing all about gas prices increasing I start to wonder if I should slow down - drive like Granny in the hot rod Lincoln.&nbsp; I go to fill up and, WTF, $55?&nbsp; I look on the ground for a hole for gas to be leaking, but realize that Premium was $3.29.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>I shake my head and decide then, to pull the chip and drive like granny last week.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Best gas mileage I got in the hot rod <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City> driving like I was before was around 17.8 MPG.&nbsp; I never could break 18 MPG.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>This morning I filled up today, and noticed I've gone for well over a week without filling - a first here in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dallas</st1:place></st1:City>.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>How about 24.1 MPG?&nbsp; Now this did not come easy.&nbsp; I have been driving like Granny with an Instant MPG digital readout on the dash.&nbsp; And let me tell you, it's very hard to drive to where that sucker says 20 MPG or higher at all times.&nbsp; VERY hard.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Try keeping your speed at 55 to 60 MPH on the Tollway, with all of the dips and going up the dips?&nbsp; Not possible.&nbsp; Try accelerating from a red light.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to keep the RPMs under 1500 RPMs.&nbsp; Not easy to do in a hot rod <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lincoln</st1:place></st1:City> that loves hole-shots with the 3000 Stall, HiPo transmission, and custom tune.&nbsp; And God forbid that a light that is red and I'm slowing down for turns green - the Instant MPG drops to 5 MPG.&nbsp; Doh!<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>The moral of this post?&nbsp; To where I thought I wasn't an aggressive driver, after all of the schools, tickets, citations, running from the cops (oops, didn't mean that), peeling out, barking 2nd gear, smoking 4th in the Cobra, etc over the last decade...&nbsp; Nothing was as much clear to me to when I found out about the gas I have been wasting over the years.<o:p></o:p></P>
<P>Damn.&nbsp; I actually was an aggressive driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;But not any more.&nbsp; :)<o:p></o:p></P>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<img align="right" border="0" height="463" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/google-condones-spamming.jpg" /><p>Precursor: BlogSpot (owned and operated by Google, Inc&nbsp;) is spamming.&nbsp; </p><p>&quot;There, I said it.&quot;, quoting David Spade as it&#39;s what I&#39;m saying now.</p><p>Ever since I upgraded to CS 2.0 from a previous version, I have been getting flooded with a large number of spam comments to my blog posts, about 20 to 30 a day.&nbsp;Where they come from seems to be related to online poker and porn sites.</p><p>Now I&#39;ve set CS 2.0 to allow anonymous comments, but they will be Disapproved when posted here - until I go in and approve them.</p><p>But somehow these spambots get past this restriction in CS 2.0, and flood my blog comments.&nbsp; I have this logged as a bug in CS 2.0, to be resolved in CS 2.1.&nbsp; But for now, we must fight this.</p><p>One way is to enable the Spam CSModule that now comes with CS 2.0.&nbsp; Have it look for more then 5 links in a comment, then automatically disapprove or even delete the post.&nbsp; </p><p>I went a more drastic approach and started to find the source of these boneheads.&nbsp; </p><p>I found them - BlogSpot.com is the home to all of this Poker spamming.&nbsp; I found them by looking at my Urchin web stats and started comparing these odd Referral urls below to the time entries of the recent spamming comments.&nbsp;

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P><STRONG>Update 2006-08-25:</STRONG> In the comments below&nbsp;I mentioned a 2nd method that loops through all objects on the page and "re-injects" them.&nbsp; This actually works very well and lets you use the&nbsp;&lt;object&gt; tags normally without worrying about the javascript below&nbsp;(if placed in the correct location in CS).&nbsp; It works with Windows Media Player, Flash, and any other &lt;object&gt; tag.&nbsp; Here's the link:</P>
<P><A href="http://www.mix-fx.com/flash-prompt.htm" target=_blank rel=nofollow>http://www.mix-fx.com/flash-prompt.htm</A> </P>
<P>The downside is it is only supported in newer browsers that support the document.getElementsByTagName - which most do these days.&nbsp; But I like to code for old 4.0 and above browsers (my JS is all 4.0+, including Netscape 4.08).&nbsp; I might modify his code to do this when I get back from vacation.</P>
<P>You can continue read the history of this issue below.</P>
<P>--------------------</P>
<P>So with a recent Internal Explorer patch (automatic update), you might start noticing that you have to click a Flash, Quicktime, Realplayer, or WMV in order to "use" the control.&nbsp; Annoying right?</P>
<P>The mouse-over presents the text, "<EM>Click to activate and use this control</EM>".&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is due to a recent court battle that MS lost in the way IE deals with &lt;object&gt; and &lt;embed&gt; tags.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>The Fix</FONT></STRONG><BR>Recently I am working on my building's website at <A href="http://www.2220cantonlofts.com/">www.2220cantonlofts.com</A>.&nbsp; Now the new page isn't online yet, give me until the end of June to complete it.&nbsp; And yes I know what is currently&nbsp; there sucks ass.&nbsp; That's why I am overhauling it.&nbsp; Anyhoot...&nbsp; I'm using two flash movies and noticed this problem - and it ticking me off.</P>
<P>To fix this it&nbsp;took some playing with the HTML and object tags.&nbsp; Basically I found that if you render the HTML after the page has rendered (i.e. InsertHtml), it does not require you to click to activate.</P>
<P>Appearently <A href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/activecontent/articles/devletter.html">Macromedia</A> found out about this and posted an "IE" fix.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I believe it needs a little tweaking because most of use querystrings and have multiple flash versions on our site.</P>
<P>I'll sum it up for you in full.</P>
<P>The fix is insert the&nbsp;<FONT face="Courier New"><FONT size=2>&lt;object/embed&gt; </FONT></FONT>text&nbsp;while the page is rendering/being interpreted by the browser.&nbsp; So long as it doesn't exist in the source/html file.&nbsp; It&nbsp;must be&nbsp;rendered outside of the source file.</P>
<P>Instructions to install:</P>

<P>That's it.</P>
<P>Now the attached JS is slightly modified then the version you can download from Macromedia.&nbsp; I simply had too many .swf files with querystring as attributes.&nbsp; The script at Macromedia's site requires you to remove the .swf - it's annoying to remove that from all of my code.&nbsp; So I edited their code.</P>
<P>Check out <A href="http://www.2220cantonlofts.com/">www.2220cantonlofts.com</A> to see it working.</P>

MPEG-4 is an International Standards Organization (ISO) specification that covers many aspects of multimedia presentation including compression, authoring and delivery. Although video compression and file container definition are two separate and independent entities of the MPEG-4 specification, many people incorrectly believe that the two are interchangeable. You can implement only portions of the MPEG-4 specification and remain compliant with the standard. <BR><BR>The MPEG-4 file format, as defined by the MPEG-4 specification, contains MPEG-4 encoded video and Advanced Audio Coding (AAC)-encoded audio content. It typically uses the .mp4 extension. Windows Media Player does not support the playback of the .mp4 file format. You can play back .mp4 media files in Windows Media Player when you install DirectShow-compatible MPEG-4 decoder packs. DirectShow-compatible MPEG-4 decoder packs include the Ligos LSX-MPEG Player and the EnvivioTV.<BR><BR>For more information about the Ligos LSX-MPEG Player, visit the following Ligos Web site:

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[In addition, QuickTime will play MP4s out of the box.  But the content will have to be generated by QuickTime itself, which in my eyes means it's the same as an MOV file - being that it is specific to QuickTime (see MS comments above how there isn't any standard to the extensions to MP4, which is why it is hard to support).

So if QuickTime makes its own MP4 files, it's safe to say that they will be playable in QuickTime on client machines.  But what about other decoders?  They will have to keep up with whatever QuickTime decides on the formats.

I'd say just use an existing widely supported method.  Like Flash5 or MPEG3.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I really apologize for the corruption.

CommunityServer corrupts blog attachments when upgraded from CS 2.0 to CS 2.1.

If I had known at the time, I would have copied the file first.  But at last, I do not have a copy of that file anywhere.

I can write another if you like.

Hey Joshua:

CS 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0 are vastly different for this approach.

Contact me via email eric-VIA-eduncan911.com, or the Contact me link in the header bar.

<P>What I found interesting is the age-old techniques I've used to track down hackers (and prosecute them in court, via companies that have hired me in the past) has become so commonly understood these days that they explain it in their recent lawsuit against <A href="http://engadget.com/tag/viodentia" target=_blank mce_href="http://engadget.com/tag/viodentia">Viodentia</A> - and people understand exactly the process.</P>
<P>See, back in the day (late 80s, early 90s) no one had a clue how to track down a hacker.&nbsp; I made some side cash tracking down these guys so long ago cause no one knew the technology enough.&nbsp; Now someone makes a post, and it amazes me how common-knowledge it has become.</P>
<P>Now don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I've done my fair-share of cracks and hacks, and knew enough about re-writing the tcp stack to hide my tracks.&nbsp; So don't get pissed if it was me that testified against you way back then.&nbsp; Did I do it&nbsp;against the underground pirate groups?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It was for those guys that would hack into computers of friends of mine to do nothing more then destroy their networks.</P>
<P>Aren't the best Security Experts the best hackers?&nbsp; Was always my sales pitch in the&nbsp; past for such jobs.&nbsp; :)</P>
<P>Err, off the point.&nbsp; <A href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/26/microsoft-sues-viodenta-for-copyright-infringement/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/26/microsoft-sues-viodenta-for-copyright-infringement/">The post above</A> clearly outlines one of the most common methods for tracking a hacker.</P>
<P>ISPs will not talk to you unless you have a court order.&nbsp; So create a suit (as MS did above), then talk to the ISPs.&nbsp; They will gladly hand over any and all records.&nbsp; Which most of the time you can track to a single IP and MAC address at that time of the email/file submission/port connectivity/logs/etc.&nbsp; MACs on broadband are linked to a physical&nbsp;address on file for that user that is being billed, which will be handed over via the ISP.&nbsp; Either have the feds ask for the warrant, or contact the local courts for the area to obtain one - and have the local PD/fbi unit conduct the search/arrest.</P>
<P>Rest is normal process.&nbsp; </P>
<P>There are dozens of way to get around the above, that most hackers don't even attempt.&nbsp; Like accessing a computer&nbsp;has been hacked, then a remote hacker would piggy back everything they do off of that machine.&nbsp; That's just one of many ways.</P>
<P>Now in this case, <A href="http://engadget.com/tag/viodentia" target=_blank mce_href="http://engadget.com/tag/viodentia">Viodentia</A> claims to live outside of the United States.&nbsp; That's good and bad, depending on his country.&nbsp; This adds an extra (and extra thick) layer of law process, as you now must go through federal courts to obtain an extradition.&nbsp; Now this I have never been involved with, so I'll leave that part up to the lawyers.</P>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I kind of ended that too quickly.  

To address Viodentia and would I track him down?  Hell now!  I do not agree with the DMCA, and will not.  I won't give a hint, but I still host decss on an old old site - that isn't related to me.

It was the DMCA that held back DVD technology from the US for 6 years.  It was the DMCA that has spurred a huge need for copyrighting digital media, which seems so easily foiled.

It's the chicken or the egg effect.  Which I say fry the chicken, and boil the egg to get rid of both.

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 200px; HEIGHT: 160px" align=left src="http://www.comedycentral.com/images/shows/southpark/videos/season_10/1008_warcraft_m4.jpg" width=200 height=160 mce_src="http://www.comedycentral.com/images/shows/southpark/videos/season_10/1008_warcraft_m4.jpg">7 weeks 5 days 13 hours 20 minutes - That's how long the boys from Southpark must play WoW, allowing 3 hours a night for sleep, in order to level up with their combined forces to have a 90% mortality rate against the ultimate super-player online.</P>
<P>I think what I just said about made some kind of sense to WoW players.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What had me rolling on the floor tonight, laughing my butt off?&nbsp; SouthPark.&nbsp; The 10th season premier was just on, and it had a huge spoof on&nbsp;the World of Warcraft online playing.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Basically, this one player has been online since WoW came out 18 months ago playing it almost 24/7.&nbsp; He's leveled up so high, that he's been killing players without having to accept his challenge - even killing admins off.</P>
<P>The show continues to spoof the "over the average" online player by showing the deterioration of health users go through if they do nothing but sit in front of the computer, 21 hours a day (3 hours to sleep) playing WoW.</P>
<P>Kind of reminds me about the <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8hfK3RQs2g" mce_href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8hfK3RQs2g">16 year old boy in&nbsp;Australia</A> that recently was on the news playing WoW, almost 18 hours a day.&nbsp; He's punched holes in the walls, thrown pc components around the room, and more.</P>
<P>Anyhoot, any decent WoW fan (or SouthPark fan) needs to check out this episode titled <EM>Make Love not Warcraft</EM>.</P>

I'd say that Blizzard didn't pay anything for it.  Since it shows the irony of playing it hardcore, for nothing.

I was close to getting WoW recently, until that episode.  Kind of glad I don't have it now since I don't have that much time for anything like that.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 119px; HEIGHT: 170px" height=170 src="http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/photos/uncategorized/71128149.jpg" width=119 align=left mce_src="http://ccinsider.comedycentral.com/photos/uncategorized/71128149.jpg">Congrats to the creators of South Park for the aware earlier this year (yeah I just found out).&nbsp; John Stewart here was the person who presented it to the creators, Trey Park and Matt Stone.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this doesn't open people's eyes to the humor they try to portray in today's media events, then I suppose it never will.</P>
<P>South Park was praised as a show that "pushes all the buttons, turns up the heat and shatters every taboo,"<A href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=1809777" target=_blank mce_href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=1809777"> Peabody Awards Director Horace Newcomb</A> said. "Through that process of offending it reminds us of the need for being tolerant." </P>
<P>Constantly while talking to several people, one out of every two seem to despise South Park for one thing or another.&nbsp; People still don't get&nbsp;the underlying humor.&nbsp; You can read in an earlier post about <A title="Profit Mohamed removed from South Park " href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/2006/04/14/Death-to-Free-Speech_3A00_-Profit-Mohamed-removed-from-South-Park.aspx" mce_href="/archive/2006/04/14/Death-to-Free-Speech_3A00_-Profit-Mohamed-removed-from-South-Park.aspx">my stance on South Park</A> of where I go into more detail.</P>
<P>Until they start doing "You'd might be a redneck if..."-type jokes (as one Jeff Foxworthy mentioned has made me a redneck, lol), and one must hit home with me, I welcome their humor.&nbsp; And even if they do hit home, oh well.&nbsp; :)</P>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[MiXX.PostIcon released to the public]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P mce_keep="true"><STRONG>EDIT 6/05/2007: Changed links to CS 3.0 version.&nbsp; Subscribe to here for updates: </STRONG><A href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/tags/The+MiXX+Collection/default.aspx"><STRONG>http://eduncan911.com/archive/tags/The+MiXX+Collection/default.aspx</STRONG></A></P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P mce_keep="true">Some of you might have noticed my new homepage over the last month.&nbsp; Those of you using an RSS reader to read this, go check out my homepage for the new PostIcon module I'm talking about.</P>
<P><A href="http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/5894/download.aspx"></A></P><STRONG>What is it?<BR></STRONG>The purpose of this Server Control and CSModule is to automatically<BR>create a small lightweight PostIcon with little to no work on your part.<BR>Just embed a normal image, bam, you have a PostIcon automatically. 
<P>This module creates the PostIcon for a Weblog Post during its creation <BR>and/or update physically on disk. It will connect to your image source, <BR>load into memory, crop, resize, compress, and save the tiny ~2 KB file <BR>to disk. It then adds the full pathname to an ExtendedAttribute for that<BR>post called "PostIcon", allowing for the skin to render where required. <BR>This storage-to-disk method greatly speeds up the homepage rendering as <BR>we do not access the photo gallery.</P>
<P>To use, simply create a blog post with at least one &lt;img&gt; embedded.&nbsp; <BR>That's it.&nbsp; The default logic above will take the first &lt;img&gt; in your<BR>post and process it to disk.</P>
<P>Optionally, you can specify a particular image to use as your PostIcon.<BR>Say if you had multple embedded &lt;img&gt;s, or if you don't have an image at<BR>all but wanted a PostIcon for the post. </P>
<P>You can use the BBCode format of:</P>
<P>&nbsp;[PostIcon Anchor = "Center"]http://domain.com/image.gif[/PostIcon]</P>
<P>This will allow you to specify an Anchor position, if you want to crop<BR>in a certain region.&nbsp; The Anchor attribute is optional.&nbsp; See the<BR>module's config file for more information on Anchor.</P>
<P><STRONG>How does it work?</STRONG><BR>There are two parts to make this work.&nbsp; The backend uses the PostIconModule&nbsp;to download into memory, crop, resize, compress, and save the selected image to disk.</P>
<P>And the frontend UI uses the PostIcon server control to rendered the saved image, with smart logic.</P>
<P><STRONG>What is the logic to determine what gets downloaded, cropped, and saved or even displayed if none is set?<BR></STRONG>There are two methods of logic.&nbsp; The first is which image, if any at all, is processed on the initial PostCreation process.&nbsp; And the other logic is in the PostIcon server control that renders, if there is no image saved from the module.</P>
<P>The PostIconModule determines what url gets written to the post, if any.&nbsp; It does this by following the order below:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Does the [PostIcon] BBCode exist?&nbsp;If so, parse the image specified.</LI>
<LI>Is there an &lt;img&gt; declaration somewhere in the post?&nbsp; If so, parse the first &lt;img&gt; and use it as the PostIcon.</LI></OL>
<P>If the PostIconModule fails to parse the image, no url is written.&nbsp; In which case, the PostIcon server control determines what gets displayed with the logic below:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Is there a DefaultImageUrl specified?&nbsp; If so, link directly to it.</LI>
<LI>Is the UseAnonymousAvatar set to true?&nbsp; If so, link directly to it.</LI></OL>
<P><STRONG>Why are you saving to disk and writing a direct url?&nbsp; Isn't the Photo Gallery built for that?</STRONG><BR>Yes, it is but&nbsp; I wanted speed on my homepage.&nbsp; And loading the Weblog posts + 20 to 50 images on the homepage is a bit more processing then I care for.</P>
<P>So with the PostIconModule I load the image into a MemoryStream, crop the image based on the Anchor set, resize the image to what is specified in the config, compress it as a JPG (tests showed 60% quality compared to Gif 89a and PNG is smaller then all), and finally save it to disk.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The PostIcon server control loads only the direct Url that is stored for the post, therefore generating a very quick homepage load time.</P>
<P><STRONG>Where's the source code?</STRONG><BR>With the rest of the files below.</P>
<P><STRONG>Where do I get this wonderful tool?</STRONG><BR>Here ya go:</P>
<P>(install only)<BR><A href="http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/2611/download.aspx">http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/2611/download.aspx</A><A href="http://eduncan911.com/Downloads/MiXXCollection-CS30-v1.0.zip"></A></P>
<P>(source code-must compile)<BR><A href="http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/5894/download.aspx">http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/5894/download.aspx</A></P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG>Future Releases<BR></STRONG>If by popular demand, I might add in rendering of the User's Avatar if multiple people are posting to a single blog.&nbsp; But since this is rare, I skipped it for now.</P>
<P>Also if by popular demand, I may add in some type of Email detection (i.e. MetaBlog API posts) and display a custom image (if the image logic fails to save one).&nbsp; For example, I might want to display a common PostIcon for all posts <A class="" href="http://www.blogmailr.com/blog/archive/2006/11/07/blogmailr-com-is-live.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.blogmailr.com/blog/archive/2006/11/07/blogmailr-com-is-live.aspx">made by Blogmailr</A>.&nbsp; Such as this one:</P>

Register the server control's tag prefix by adding this to the top of your skin(s) file you are using it on:

I haven't quite built that portion out yet, as I was waiting for others to ask about it first.  But just for you, I'll add it in for the next release.  :)

It seems everyone hasn't had any issues.  So the next release should include the source.

There's two main issues that have popped up.  Make sure you have write access to your web directory, and that the /configs/ folder exists, and the config file with in.

I'm coming up with a slight variance of what's in the config.  Working just like the seperate file does not, but give the option to put the settings inline of the CSModule line of cs.config.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey Joshua:

I've been meaning to test it out with CS 2k7, but haven't gotten around to it yet.  Within the next week or two, I will.

If the PostIcon is being created on disk, then that tells me the Config and CSModules are working.  It's just a matter of accessing the extended attributes of the Post object, which might have changed with CS 3.0.

Try this: Get a PostID of one of your posts (if you edit a post in the control panel, look at the URL - it will tell you the PostID of the post).

Once you have the PostID, run this in your database:

SELECT PostID, PropertyNames, PropertyValues FROM cs_Posts WHERE PostID = 11

And replace "11" with whatever PostID you have.  Copy and paste the results and email me at eric -at- eduncan911.com so I can see if things are being set right.


Well, it's either that or wait a few weeks until I get the bandwidth to install CS 2k7 and do some testing.

Looking at your previous instructions I looked at the post entry in dbo.cs_Posts and here it is:

PropertyNames
-------------
enableAllOwnerNotification:S:0:4:
EnableRatings:S:4:4:
EnableTrackBacks:S:8:4:
enableCrossPosting:S:12:5:
CommentModerationType:S:17:9:

EverPublished:S:56:4:

PropertyValues
--------------
True
True
True
False
Anonymous
2
~/blogs/PostIcons/doug//0.jpg
True

So it looks like the entry in question is:

PostIconUrl = ~/blogs/PostIcons/doug//0.jpg

Checking the server, the following WAS created:

/website/blogs/PostIcons/doug/0.jpg

And checking the file 0.jpg it is in fact a small version of the <IMG> I put in my test post.

In the PostIconUrl property why the double slash? (//)

My username is "doug" and the blog folder/name is "doug_clyde" - is your module supposed to be creating subfolders based off of name or blog name?

Thanks in advance for any pointers you have!

I'm sorry but Joshua and I have been emailing offline for a resolution (this is why I like public posts, so everyone can see the resolution). Basically 

we've traced it to the PostIcon Image writer Control for the page. It has a bug where CS 2k7 changed the PostAttachment logic (yet again!), and broke backwards compatibility (yet again!).  I haven't updated my version yet.

Joshua above was able to get it working "for now" by using the PostID and generating the url directly with something like (this is my untested thought/code to use as a "hack" for now, until I release another update):

  <img src="~/blogs/PostIcons/doug/<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "PostID") %>.jpg" runat="server" />

Not sure if that will parse (remove the runat, and the tilda "~" if it doesn't work).  But basically, the image is named from the PostID.  

And to answer your questions: The double-slash comes from a config setting (it doens't hurt anything, as browses ignore double slashes). And the path "~/blogs/PostIcons/doug/" is generated from the Username that posted the image (so to trace who posted what image where - in case there are multiple authors for a single blog) - it does not derrive from the Blog's AppKey.

I'll get an updated version soon (about 3 days behind on figuring this out, busy @ work at the moment).]]></content>

By the way, something else I just noticed for your consideration: the image created was "0.jpg" - which is NOT the post ID for the related post (PostID is in the 2000 range).

Seriously I appreciate all your help.  It's nice for us lower on the programming ladder to have someone who's willing to help us climb!]]></content>

Hey Doug:

Humm, so 0.jpg eh?  That's not what Josh and others reported.  Something else is a-miss here.

Looks like I'm going to have a lot of fun with CS 2k7 soon.

ETA, EOW next week - if you can wait?  :)

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[thought i'd add another observation:

the PostID seems to always be 0 when using Windows Live Writer to publish a new post.  the icons end up as "0.jpg", and is referenced as such in the extended attributes.  however, reloading the post from the blog and re-publishing will fix the problem.

the strange part of this effect is if WLW is used to publish several new posts, without reloading etc., they will all share the latest 0.jpg created.

nice feature ;-)

First Eric, sorry I haven't been in touch lately. We ended up reverting back to CS2.1 for the last install we were doing. That said, we have a new project and we are determined to get PostIcon working with 2007 this time. I will certainly respond back to this post if/how we get it up and running. Thanks again Eric for a cool add on to CS. 

Hopefully will be back in touch soon with cool news!

Thanks!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey Seth:

It works for CS2007.  But in CS2007.1, this does require a configuration change.

CS 2007.1 changed a fundimental node in CommunityServer.config from "Modules" to "CSModules".

I need to update the readme for yet another change to CS 2007.1.

Now, there are two different sets of instructions.  

- CS 2007, use <Modules>.  
- CS 2007.1, use <CSModules>.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I had to do it to four different machines.  

*  My home desktop (new install of XP, and new install of FF 1.5 two months ago).

* My laptop (upgrade from FF 1.5 to FF 2.0)

* My parents computer (new install of FF2 over Xmas 2006)

* My sister's new laptop for Xmas.  At which, I just got fed up and un-installed it from all of the above machines - except my development laptop.


Remember, I do not use FF mainstream, so I never "enabled" the old plugins, before the upgrades of WMP and Flash.  How old is your FF install?  Not asking how new your FF2 install is, but how old was the original time you installed FF1.5 or alike and have upgraded from there?  It seems upgrades aren't effected, just new installs.]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Interesting String.GetHashCode() issue between ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Today a fellow co-worker, <A class="" href="http://sqladvice.com/blogs/dpenton/" target=_blank mce_href="http://sqladvice.com/blogs/dpenton/">David Penton</A>,&nbsp;ran into an interesting issue about a background&nbsp;ASP.NET&nbsp;thread using ASP.NET 2.0, instead of ASP.NET 1.1 when the individual website was set to run under 1.1.</P>
<P>First a little background.&nbsp; The internal staging server is Windows 2003 R2.&nbsp; In the past&nbsp;Windows 2003 would throw an exception at the web application level when two or more websites were sharing the same application pool, and they were set to different versions of ASP.NET.&nbsp; The R2 release seems to have resolved this issue, hence our IT Administrator running most sites under the common Default Application Pool.</P>
<P>We have a client that requires an ASP.NET 1.1 build of the website.&nbsp; So&nbsp;the developer&nbsp;was working within VS2k3.&nbsp; The background processes in question of the web application is to process the searching algorithm we use for an out-of-the-box CommunityServer install (nicknamed the SearchBarrel).&nbsp; We have an Enterprise Search addon available that uses <FONT size=2>Lucene</FONT>.NET, but for this client they are using the search barrel.&nbsp; The SearchBarrel breaks up a post into individual words, then issues a ToLower() and then GetHashCode() on the string for each word.&nbsp; We store this Int32 hash in the database as number matching is faster to index than string matching.</P>
<P>The String.GetHashCode() method is different between .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0.&nbsp; So when you are upgrading an application from 1.1 to 2.0, and you are storing the HashCode for strings somewhere, you'll have to generate new HashCodes in .NET 2.0.</P>
<P>The issue the developer ran into was very odd.&nbsp; The post was&nbsp;using a mix of English and Chinese, so we are dealing with an extended character set as well.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="courier new,courier">(The word we are trying to hash)<BR>ps3对蓝光技术的采用也是令大家称道的原因之一&nbsp;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When a single word mixed English and binary characters without spaces (i.e. Chinese Simplified as above), the background SearchBarrel CSJob (the thread) would generate an ASP.NET&nbsp;2.0 HashCode for the above word!&nbsp;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="courier new,courier">(.NET 2.0 HashCode of the word above)<BR>-309760669<BR><BR>(.NET 1.1 HashCode of the word above)<BR><FONT size=2>1104497610</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yes, the website was set to ASP.NET 1.1.&nbsp; Yes, the binaries were built under .NET 1.1.&nbsp; But yet, we were getting an .NET 2.0 hashcode.&nbsp; The only thing&nbsp;that came to my mind was&nbsp;that it was using the default application pool, which was shared with many other staging websites - mostly ASP.NET 2.0 sites I'm guessing (since most of our clients have moved to ASP.NET 2.0).</P>
<P>It gets even odder.&nbsp; If the developer was to edit the post, change that one word of mixed English and Chinese characters to insert a space between the two different languages, clearing the search barrel and letting the background thread re-hash the post - it would then use ASP.NET 1.1 to generate the HashCode!</P>
<P>Very very odd.&nbsp; And we could re-produce it consistently by adding and removing that space and forcing the searchbarrel to rebuild.</P>
<P>The only thing we could guess is that .NET 1.1 choked on the English + Chinese character mix when encoding the hashcode and somehow reverted back to&nbsp;ASP.NET 2.0 to generate the GetHashCode() method.</P>
<P>The fix?&nbsp; Move the website to its own dedicated Application Pool.</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey Mustafa:

Well, in your case there isn't a direct fix.  Because .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0 have different HashCode values, you're going to have to migrate your data.

The steps would be something like:
* Using an .NET 1.1 application, get the old password and store them in a table (maybe convert to ClearText in the same table during this temp period?)
* Create another application, but compiled under .NET 2.0.  This application will take your temp clear-text passwords, convert them to HashCodes for .NET 2.0, and store them back into your original Users table.

The bug mentioned above in my post relates to running multiple 1.1 and 2.0 applications in the same Application Pool on W2K3 R2 servers.  Sometimes the HashCode defaults to 1.1, other times it's at 2.0 depending on the "space", standard characters, and in extended character sets.

Hope that helps!

BTW, how about a PostIcon update for CS3? I just can't bring myself to update my site to CS3 without the PostIcons.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey Dan!

As far as I can see, I think the PostIcon will work as-is for CS3.  I'm about to skin my blog for CS3 beta, so I'll let you know in a few weeks (will do on vacation).

And as far "leaving the site alone" to get other work done.. lol  I haven't touched this site since November (except for the PostIcon update, obviously).  I'll get to an update about every 3 to 4 months - and it's time!

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Enabling HTTP Compression with ASPX]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Here's a quick-n-easy post about enabling HTTP Compression on your server, as I've done over the weekend.&nbsp; But instead of reading endless blog posts about it, and MSDN articles about enabling each and every step, I've compiled it all into a single CMD script you can copy and run on your server.&nbsp; Easy.</P>
<P>First a tiny bit of background...&nbsp; Yeah, I am so late to this game.&nbsp; For a while I heard the buzz word, but only thought it was similar to Analog Modem compression (back when I worked for Hayes) to where both modems must support a common compression algorythm, which was mostly never the case.&nbsp; Hence the "Call these sets of numbers if you have a USR, call this number if you have a Hayes modem, etc" you may remember back in the modem days.</P>
<P>After reading up on HTTP Compression <A class="" title=MSDN2 href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/502ef631-3695-4616-b268-cbe7cf1351ce.mspx?mfr=true" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/502ef631-3695-4616-b268-cbe7cf1351ce.mspx?mfr=true">here</A> this weekend, boy have I missed the boat.&nbsp; I've enabled it on my server over the weekend, over most dynamic file types, and it's really picking up speed now (page loads seem faster).&nbsp; I also found a nifty <A class="" href="http://www.seoconsultants.com/tools/compression.asp" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.seoconsultants.com/tools/compression.asp">HTTP Compression Test </A>website, that ensured me I finally got it enabled (it was a PITA for additional extensions).</P>
<P>Now the problem I had with HTTP Compression was the default list of extensions are very limited.&nbsp; And it only does asp for dynamic content?&nbsp; In IIE6?&nbsp; You'd think they would default to aspx and asp.</P>
<P>Note that you will need to enable HTTP Compresison first, before running the attached script.&nbsp; <A class="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/502ef631-3695-4616-b268-cbe7cf1351ce.mspx?mfr=true" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/502ef631-3695-4616-b268-cbe7cf1351ce.mspx?mfr=true">Instructions can be found here</A>&nbsp;and just read the Procedures part. Don't worry about running the scripts in that article as the attachment takes care of that, and additional extensions.</P>
<P>The<STRONG>&nbsp;<EM>attached script enables&nbsp;static and dynamic compression types as listed below</EM></STRONG>.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Dynamic Types</STRONG>: ASP, DLL, EXE, ASPX, ASCX, ASMX, ASHX</P>
<P><STRONG>Static Types</STRONG>: HTM, HTML, TXT, PPT, XLS, XML, PDF, XSLT, DOC, XSL, HTC, JS, CSS</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You'll notice a few up for debate in that list, such as ASCX and PDF.&nbsp; The debates ranged all over the web and saw it as an advantage more then disadvantage.&nbsp; So over the next few weeks, I ask those I am hosting on my server to see if any dynamic content isn't so dynamic.&nbsp; Kind of like a passive-monitoring approach by asking my users to see if they notice any difference.</P>
<P>About the PDF, some websites generate dynamic PDF content.&nbsp; But usually it's just encoded as a PDF MIME-TYPE, and doesn't actually have the extension of PDF.&nbsp; IIS6's HTTP Compression is based off of extensions, not the mime-type.&nbsp; So I classified it as static.</P>
<P>A little script support. &nbsp;First, this script assumes your OS is installed on C:.&nbsp; And it assumes you have the file adsutil.vbs located at C:\InetPub\AdminScripts\ (default location).&nbsp; If different locations, you can edit the script file as need be.&nbsp; Besides that, you must be running at least W2K3 or R2 and as mentioned above already have HTTP Compression enabled.&nbsp; Haven't tested this yet on IIS7 (Longhorn) yet.</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[That's a good point Bill and one that is highly debated on the net.  But I believe the arguments are that the temp files created from compiling the ASCX file gets compressed, causing less server memory to serve-up the requested file.

HTTP Compression is more then serving up compressed files to the client's browser, which this I didn't know until I started to enable it.  IIS actually compresses each file, and stores a copy of that compressed file in a seperate directory for reference. 

But after looking at the temp compressed directory on this server, I see there are no .aspx nor .ascx files in there.  Only static types listed above.

I will have to do a bit of research (or anyone else that wants to comment here) about how IIS compressed Dynamic content - i.e. where does it store them?  On-the-fly compression?

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Dynamic Instance Names of TextFields - A work around]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>As I am starting to get back into heavy Flash development&nbsp;after my 5+ year hiatus, I see that Macromedia has added quite a lot of interesting concepts to the newer versions of ActionScript.</P>
<P>But the purpose of this post is to outline that Macromedia (err now Adobe) still has a lot of work to do on their ActionScript engine, specifically with Dynamic Instance naming conventions (and new-object intellisense would really be nice by now, after all of these years).&nbsp;&nbsp;I am assuming you know flash, a little bit.&nbsp; At least to the level of knowing that you need set an InstanceName of a Symbol, in order to be able to edit its properties at runtime.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I just spent too much time today trying to figure out why my code wasn't working.&nbsp; I am creating numerous dynamic TextFields, but I need to be able to access them for updates in code.&nbsp; And to complicate things, the TextFields will be loaded from different XML files - meaning they will have different InstanceNames.</P>
<P>You usually can create a dynamic instance name by using the old-school method of&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">hardCodedName[variable]</SPAN> or the even older&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">eval("hardCodedName" + variable)</SPAN> method.&nbsp; For example, say I want to create a new movie into a dynamic variable made up of an integer I have in a for i++ loop:</P><PRE><CODE>for (int i = 0; i &lt; total; i++)
{
  loadMovie( "myMovie" + i + ".swf", _root.myMovie[ i ] );
}
</CODE></PRE>
<P>Or...</P><PRE><CODE>for (int i = 0; i &lt; total; i++)
{
  loadMovie( "myMovie" + i + ".swf", _root.eval("myMovie" + i) );
}
</CODE></PRE>
<P>Both of these examples should result in loading myMovie0.swf into the dynamic variable name of /level0/myMovie0 (or _root.myMovie0 per dot-syntax).&nbsp; </P>
<P>What&nbsp;I found today is that when using some of the newer ActionScript 2.0 and 3.0 functions, they do not honor these methods completely.&nbsp; I had to use a mixture of the two examples above to get it work, and actually could not use either method when creating the object!&nbsp; This is the craziest thing I've seen to where eval() works in referencing the object, but does not work in the creation of the object.&nbsp; </P><PRE><CODE>var _root.totalCount:Number = 0;
function CreateMenuItem(Text:String, Href:String, Title:String, Spacer:Boolean)
{
    // create the symbol at the last Y position we are tracking
    this.createTextField("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount
        , _root.totalCount, _root.textXpos, _root.lastYpos, _root.textWidth, _root.textHeight);
    eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount).wordWrap = true;
    eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount).multiline = true;
    eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount).border = false;
    eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount).type = "dynamic";
    eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount).antiAliasType = "advanced";
    
    textFormat = new TextFormat();
    textFormat.color = 0xffffff;
    textFormat.size = 12;
    textFormat.font = "Futura Condensed";
    
    if (Spacer != true)
    {
      formatText.url = Href;
    }
    
    if (Text.length &gt; 0)
    {
        eval("movFlyoutText" +  _root.totalCount).text = Text;
    }
    else
    {
        eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount).text = " ";
    }
    
    eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount).setTextFormat(textFormat);
    
    // reset some vars
    var tmp:Number = eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount)._height;
    _root.lastYpos = _root.lastYpos + tmp;
    
    _root.totalCount++;
}

</CODE></PRE>
<P>Above is the code I wrote today, to where I can not use [] reference or the eval() reference to get the TextField created properly using the newer <SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; COLOR: blue; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">createTextField</SPAN>method.&nbsp; But in other methods throughout my code, using the [] reference works at the baseline.&nbsp; Go figure.</P>
<P>And as mentioned above, I can not use brackets[] when referencing the object either to set its properties!&nbsp; I had to use eval().&nbsp; Man, how ugly is this code?&nbsp; I'm open to other suggestions.</P>[posticon]http://www.adobe.com/support/flash/images/h1_icon.gif[/posticon] ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Ok, I figured out with some AS 2.0 variables a way to get around the eval() methods you see above. &nbsp;Putting two and two together, I came up with defining the TextField as a new object, and referencing the eval() function. &nbsp;It worked!</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="courier new,courier"><STRONG>var newText:TextField = eval("movFlyoutText" + _root.totalCount);</STRONG></FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And now I can access the movFlyoutText[#] instance such as setting the wordWrap to true like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="courier new,courier">newText.wordWrap = true;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Please note that you still must define the TextField instance as I do above in the original post dynamically, before you can reference it like this.&nbsp; </P>
<P>AS 2.0 seems to be an attempt to conform to a standing programming model, but still sorely lacks in many fundimentals.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Macromedia (ok, now Adobe), remember me?&nbsp; The guy you tried to sue-than-hire for my previous work with Flash4 down the street from your offices in NYC?&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Well, I have a suggestion for you guys.&nbsp; Dump the cross-breeding of ActionScript versions and just make a new editor with no compatibility.&nbsp; For example, moving from Visual Studio 6.0 to Visual Studio 2003 or 2005?&nbsp; Yeah, completely new languages and formats.&nbsp; And it worked out greatly!</P>]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[MiXX Collection and PostIcon Updated for CS 2007]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>This past weekend, someone gave me a swift kick in the butt to get my MiXX Collection updated for CS 2007.&nbsp; I didn't realize it was under such high demand.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; Anyhoot during this upgrade I went ahead and refactored the source to match my other code I've been working with for other clients which lays the groundwork for me to just releasing more addons built into this collection.&nbsp;</P>
<P>The update for CommunityServer 2007 wasn't so much as code edits (there was one line that needed updating).&nbsp; But more so that you must run under Full trust.&nbsp; So I've updated the documentation to detail these steps, as well as giving pointers to those in need of accessing the Post object in the site-wide's BlogPostList repeater (not an individual BlogPostList repeater, that's easy).</P>
<P>Subscribe to The MiXX Collection RSS feed for updates and bug fixes: <A href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/tags/The+MiXX+Collection/default.aspx" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/tags/The+MiXX+Collection/default.aspx">http://eduncan911.com/archive/tags/The+MiXX+Collection/default.aspx</A></P>
<P>Here's the change log:</P>
<P>2007-06-02<BR>&nbsp;- Updated to support CommunityServer 2007.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;- Now requires you to specify Full trust level due to CS 2k7 change.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>2007-04-18<BR>&nbsp;- Re-factored into new MiXX.Core schema shared with other projects.<BR>&nbsp;- Updated to cast content as WeblogPost or IndexedPost, so PostIcon <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; can be shown in search results for Blog posts.<BR>&nbsp;- Fixed some error logging.<BR>&nbsp;- Fixed a small bug where the ImageUrl stored in the EA had a double<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;"//" in the url.&nbsp; Not a big bug, so there's no need to go back and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;re-process your old posts.&nbsp; Most browsers will render it properly.</P>
<P>2007-02-05<BR>&nbsp;- Fixed the inline &lt;img&gt; parsing bug when using the new ImageQuality<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;attribute for saving in a higher quality (a bug that was <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;introduced with backend non-released versions for testing).</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P>(install only)<BR><A href="http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/2611/download.aspx">http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/2611/download.aspx</A><A href="http://eduncan911.com/Downloads/MiXXCollection-CS30-v1.0.zip"></A></P>
<P>(source code-must compile)<BR><A href="http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/5894/download.aspx">http://eduncan911.com/files/folders/5894/download.aspx</A></P>
<P>Enjoy and post a comment to your siteurl that is using it!</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Eric, works great for new posts, but I think I screwed something up: when fudgeing with the previous version I already had some content in the blogs/PostIcons folder.  I wanted to regenerate fresh posticon images, so I purged the PostIcon folder.

So there are still images in the database that have some posticon content in the extended properties, but they no longer work because I deleted the posticon subfolders and images.

Ideas on how I can recreate the images without having to open and republish each blog entry one by one?

Thanks again!

Doug]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Heh.  You didn't have to wipe them out as I used the same format.

But yes, there's a way to do all.  Look at the documentation (/Configs/MiXX.PostIcon.txt) and you can see the options for the <MiXX:PostIcon /> server control.

There's an attribute "ParseRealtime".  Read the warning about this first.

But after you set it to True, go view your blog's homepage - the thumbnails will be re-generated all in realtime.  Then all you have to do is go paging.  I set my blog at 50 posts per page and paged through all of mine (three pages) to generate the posticons here.

Make sure to set it back to False when done.  It's hell on the AppPool.]]></content>

You don't have to enter all of that information they have there, only what I put in the readme file.

But by default, CS 2007 is set top "medium".  Try searching for just that keywork.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey Gerren:

The height/width is set in two places.  Once in the ~/Configs/MiXX.PostIcon.config.  Make sure you set this to the actual size you want stored on disk.  

And it is set (more-so "displayed" in the size you want) in the document you entered the <MiXX:PostIcon runat="server" /> control.

If you are just changing the latter, then most likely it will look funny as the default size stored in the config file is different then your server control sizes.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is very awesome!

One thing that was causing me a bit of grief until I figured it out, is that the editor was stripping out the domain for the image url.  So rather than http://mydomain.com/photos/test.jpg it was now /photos/test.jpg.  The PostIcon wouldn't generate for urls w/o the domain (either img tags or posticon bbcode).  When I added the domain back to the url for the [posticon] tag, it worked.

I'd love to be able to have it automatically generate posticons from the first img tag in the post, but if it's stripping out the domain, then I'll have to use the bbcode option w/ the entire url which takes some effort to find if using an attachment.

I remember there was a way to force the editor to not strip out the domain, but I kind of like it the way it is.

If the PostIcon could work off of relative urls, that would rock!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Thanks David!

It's the TinyMCE editor that is stripping it out.  And yes, I've thought about making PostIcon support these modified paths.

But actually, TinyMCE only strips out the domain if the domain matches the current website (something I've never agreed in their logic).  If you have another URL (i.e., put a WWW in front of your domain) that should work/let MCE ignore it.

Let us know!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Adjusting how TinyMCE deals with the url is fairly straightforward.

http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:FAQ

I do have a case where using the relative url is nice though.  That is when working on site redesigns where the new site is being developed under a different (temporary) path.  With the use of relative urls, this allows for content to be added to the site and later switched to it's permanent path w/o having to change the paths in the content.]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Living with Subversion (Part 1)]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Friends of mine&nbsp;ask a lot about my custom settings for TortoiseSVN.&nbsp; To make it play nicer with Visual Studio, easier (or should I say dumb-proofing) the auto-merging,&nbsp;performance tweaks especially on laptops, and overall tips to ensure you don't duplicate the mistakes my friends and I at Telligent have found through trial-n-error.&nbsp; I occasionally forget these myself and have to dig around a previous machine or image snapshot to find the settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;So here is a post to archive it all off for my records&nbsp;as well as for you to use for your reference.</P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>This four-part series targets the Microsoft .NET developer looking for a clean and stress-free environment utilizing Subversion for the first time, or even seasoned veterans by tweaking their installs and usability.&nbsp; It especially targets those with SourceGear Vault experience and want that clean and easy experience with Subversion.</P>
<P>So with that in mind, we will be covering a number of applications to install.&nbsp; Each with custom settings documented here that will help you get the most out of each, especially those with laptops.</P>
<H2>A few definitions and what we will be using</H2>
<P>First on&nbsp;this agenda targets those new to Subversion and its tools.&nbsp; I'm not going to bore you with the details of the history of Subversion and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System" target=_blank mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CVS</A> definitions or even how to use SubVersion.&nbsp; All of that information is available in the docs for these.&nbsp; Instead this is just a quick overview to help those moving to Subversion and what parts make it work that is out of the norm.</P>
<P><A href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target=_blank mce_href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</A> is an open-source product as you&nbsp;may already know.&nbsp; A quick misnomer to those looking to switch is that&nbsp;you do not&nbsp;have to download and install Subversion itself.&nbsp; Yes it is a client and server package that does it all, but it is not needed for&nbsp;your client (developer) machine since you are connecting remotely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?&nbsp; It's all command-line based.&nbsp; Those server admins looking for tips and&nbsp;tricks - I'll cover ya'll in another post.&nbsp; </P>
<P>What you want instead is an Subversion-compatible GUI client and there are a few out there.&nbsp; Telligent's IT guru immediately adopted <A href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target=_blank mce_href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</A> as the client for all when they switched to Subversion (i.e. only one they will support).&nbsp; I've used a few others like <A href="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/" target=_blank mce_href="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/">RapidSVN</A>&nbsp;and will have to agree that Tortoise, while being a Windows Shell Extension (yes, cringe), is the most feature-full version so far.&nbsp; But feel free to write your own and drop me a line to beta test.&nbsp; RapidSVN is coming along nicely and I continue to keep my eye on it.&nbsp; Think RapidSVN = SourceGear Vault for Subversion, a stand-alone application that doesn't integrate with Windows Explorer.&nbsp; But for now, we'll stick to TortoiseSVN until RapidSVN matures a bit more.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.sourcegear.com/">SourceGear's Vault</A> (SGV)&nbsp;is a very robust code repository system which can be configured for CVS or VSS.&nbsp; Most of us developers have fallen in&nbsp;love with SGV, but I have come to recognize&nbsp;its inability to scale with a large number of repositories,&nbsp;check-ins, and branching within a single MSSQL install.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The <A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads2.html" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.sourcegear.com/vault/downloads2.html">SGV Client</A> is what&nbsp;I install to use&nbsp;as my TortoiseSVN&nbsp;merge and diff tool.&nbsp; The SGV Client includes a nifty tool called SGDM.exe (SourceGear DiffMerge) that can be command-line driven.&nbsp; So I have been cheating by installing the SGV Client 3.1.9 (I have not used a newer version yet), linking only to&nbsp;sgdm.exe, and ignoring the rest of the install.&nbsp; And before you ask, yes the EULA for the Vault Client states a license is required to connect to a SGV repository.&nbsp; We are not connecting to a repository, just using a tool which I could not find anything the EULA preventing that or by running it in a stand-alone environment.</P>
<P>Interestingly enough&nbsp;SourceGear has released a&nbsp;<A href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html">DiffMerge</A>&nbsp;tool that is available for free, but I do not like this version.&nbsp; I noticed the command-line arguments are&nbsp;much different.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have installed it&nbsp;and tested a few merges, but&nbsp;the color-coding I did not like as much as the&nbsp;client's version of this tool.&nbsp; So for now, I am sticking to the SGV Client 3.1.9's DiffMerge tool as it is tried and true.</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Eric,

Interesting use of SGV Client - we're in a similar situation in that we're currently using a combination of SGV and SVN, and we want to migrate to SVN.  The unfortunate bit is trying to keep the history of source control changes from SGV into a new SVN repository.  Do you know of any way possible to do this?  A migration tool, perhaps?  I've been scouring the web to no avail.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[We didn't migrate at Telligent.  

Basically they gave us access to SVN and told us only new projects will be sourced via SVN.

What about labeling the last version, and just making the switch to SVN.  No history, but that's what the SGV is archived there for I suppose.

Or, make the final release of the version you're devving on and switch to SVN for the next trunkline.

But sorry, I can't help with the migration aspect.  Good luck!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Thanks for the response, Eric.  I'm thinking our best bet is to hand over the SourceGear Vault to our solutions team, as they seem keen to keep using it (something about not trusting source control outside of Visual Studio - conversely I don't trust source control _inside_ Visual Studio).  Otherwise I may have to take the approach you've mentioned here.

<H2>Configure your software</H2>
<P>After you install TortoiseSVN and SGV's Client, you will want to configure TortoiseSVN for a number of things.&nbsp; You will access this by right-clicking on your empty desktop, going to TortoiseSVN, and then to Settings.</P>

<P align=center>TortoiseSVN's Context Menu for Settings</P>
<P><STRONG>Exclude files you do not want to check-in<BR></STRONG>These includes directories to ignore such as /bin, /obj, /_sgbak, and files such as *.suo, *.pdb, *.bak and so on.&nbsp; Basically, you do not want to check-in these types of files.</P>
<P>Go to the TortoiseSVN's&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;dialog and click Edit.</P>

<P>And make sure to remove the "# " at the beginning.&nbsp; Save it and&nbsp;it should take effect immediately.&nbsp; The "cache" and "storage" folders are there because of working with CommunityServer.&nbsp; With CommunityServer, the cache and storage sub-folders are used for images and attachments for most applications.&nbsp; We don't want to check in those images, attachments, nor the thumbnails.</P>
<P><STRONG>Using underscores to prefix the hidden directories</STRONG><BR>TortoiseSVN stores the versioning information of a directory and files in a hidden svn folder, usually prefixed with a dot ".".&nbsp; This can reek havok on a few developer applications.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I check <EM><STRONG>Use "_svn" instead of ".svn" directories</STRONG></EM> on the same dialog shown above.&nbsp; Visual Studio 6.0's Interdev did not like files starting with a dot ".", and I've seen some funkiness with VS 2003.&nbsp; VS 2005 may be ok, but it is just a force of habit to use underscores instead of periods for the hidden directories.</P>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>In part three of <EM><A href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/2007/07/14/living-with-subversion-part-1.aspx" mce_href="/archive/2007/07/14/living-with-subversion-part-1.aspx">Living with Subversion</A></EM>, we cover one of the biggest reason of this series: Using a different Merge Tool.</P>
<H2>Merging conflicts&nbsp;using SourceGear Vault Client's DiffMerge</H2>
<P>Now onto one of the most useful tidbits of this article, using the trusty SGDM tool that is included with SourceGear Vault Client installation.&nbsp; I have been using SourceGear Vault Client 3.1.9 for a while now, so I am writing using that version.&nbsp; I know 3.5.x and 4.0 has been released, but our last version of SGV was 3.1.x so that's what I am used to.</P>
<P>Once installed, you do not have to do anything to the client.&nbsp; Instead, it's all about setting up Tortoise to use it as the merge tool.</P>
<P>Note: TortoiseSVN does come with its own DiffMerge tool.&nbsp; Maybe it is me too busy coding, or not spending enough time resolving conflicts, but I just cannot stand TortoiseSVN's version.&nbsp; Hence this topic.&nbsp; I am very use to SGV's robust version.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><A title=TortoiseSVN-DiffViewer href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10018165@N02/804466189/" mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10018165@N02/804466189/"><IMG border=0 alt=TortoiseSVN-DiffViewer src="http://static.flickr.com/1012/804466189_5fda7f8a80.jpg" mce_src="http://static.flickr.com/1012/804466189_5fda7f8a80.jpg"></A></P>
<P align=center>Diff Viewer Dialog</P>
<P>First, click the Diff Viewer on the left and&nbsp;select the "External" option.&nbsp; Next find/note the location of your Vault Client directory.&nbsp; There should be a sgdm.exe file here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the Diff Viewer (you will want to keep the quotation marks too) location&nbsp;to:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Courier New">"C:\Program Files\SourceGear\Vault Client\sgdm.exe" %mine %base</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Making sure the path matches obviously.&nbsp; This will put your local copy in the left panel and the repository's version in the right panel.</P>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><A title=TortoiseSVN-MergeTool href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10018165@N02/804507399/" mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10018165@N02/804507399/"><IMG border=0 alt=TortoiseSVN-MergeTool src="http://static.flickr.com/1175/804507399_4a22b60ec4.jpg" mce_src="http://static.flickr.com/1175/804507399_4a22b60ec4.jpg"></A></P>
<P align=center>Merge Tool Dialog</P>
<P>Next click the Merge Tool on thee left and select External once again.&nbsp; Using the same location of the sgdm.exe as above, paste it in.&nbsp; But this time, the command-line arguments are a good bit longer:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2 face="Courier New">"C:\Program Files\SourceGear\Vault Client\sgdm.exe" /result:%merged /title1:%yname /title2:%mname /title3:%tname %mine %merged %theirs</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will put your working version on the left panel, the repository's version in the right panel, and the TortoiseSVN's merged version in the center.</P>
<P>The trick is that now you can use SGV's DiffMerge tool, easy color coding and replace options that you are used to, overriding the TortoiseSVN's merged (and often broken) result area highlighted in bright yellow as shown below.</P>
<P align=center><A title=TortoiseSVN-DiffViewer href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eduncan911/810062741/" mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eduncan911/810062741/"><IMG border=0 alt=TortoiseSVN-DiffViewer src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/810062741_d9f3baa6fb.jpg" mce_src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/810062741_d9f3baa6fb.jpg"></A></P>
<P align=center>SGV Client's SDMG.exe opened by TortoiseSVN after a conflict</P>
<P>The Unified Diff Viewer is a viewer for CVS patch files.&nbsp; By default on Windows, TortoiseSVN uses Notepad.&nbsp; Tip: Upgrade to Notepad2 for you local notepad.exe in windows.</P>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Living with Subversion (Part 4)]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>In the forth and final part of my series, <EM><A href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/2007/07/14/living-with-subversion-part-1.aspx" mce_href="/archive/2007/07/14/living-with-subversion-part-1.aspx">Living with Subversion</A></EM>, I cover a number of performance tips and some Dos and Don'ts.</P>
<H2>Improving performance of TortoiseSVN</H2>
<P>The performance improvement aspect of this article targets those mainly on laptops that want to save battery life&nbsp;and/or slower HDD machines, or simply have just too many projects (&gt;50) within repositories.&nbsp; It is quite simple really, TortoiseSVN's&nbsp;folder icon overlays are very cool as a quick visual indication of what has changed recently.&nbsp; The problem with the icon overlays is TortoiseSVN constantly updates the status of these, especially if you are using Windows Explorer to view the folder tree no matter if you are playing a game, surfing the web, etc.</P>
<P>Still not on par with what I am explaining?&nbsp; Check out TortoiseSVN's <A href="http://tortoisesvn.net/node/267" target=_blank mce_href="http://tortoisesvn.net/node/267">Optimize Performance</A> page.&nbsp; But they have left out one key improvement: Disable the Status Cache (icon overlays).&nbsp; </P>
<P align=center><A title=TortoiseSVN-IconOverlays href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10018165@N02/804223283/" mce_href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10018165@N02/804223283/"><IMG border=0 alt=TortoiseSVN-IconOverlays src="http://static.flickr.com/1235/804223283_0dfb0aebc5.jpg" mce_src="http://static.flickr.com/1235/804223283_0dfb0aebc5.jpg"></A></P>
<P align=center>Icon Overlays Dialog</P>
<P><STRONG>Icon Overlays</STRONG><BR>I set mine Status Cache overlays to "none".&nbsp; This effectively disables the Status Cache all together.&nbsp; Just like SGV Client, you'll have to perform an Update before starting your work everyday as this will pull down&nbsp;the latest copy to start with.&nbsp; If you like the red X effect, you'll want to leave this on Default.&nbsp; I personally don't want my HDD going in insane (like it did with the dozen+ repositories and icon overlays).&nbsp; So I disable mine, period.</P>
<P>Also be sure to uncheck "Show overlays only in explorer".&nbsp; This will keep the icons out of the standard Windows dialog popups, and only show them in the Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Again if you want to see when something is out-of-sync immediately, you'll want to skip this part but sacrifice performance.</P>
<P>Our final performance increase greatly effects Windows' users.&nbsp; Setting the include paths text box.&nbsp; As described in the Optimize Performance page by TortoiseSVN, you will want to specify the directory of where your projects are stored.&nbsp; This keeps TortoiseSVN from snooping around your Windows directory for hidden svn folders - constantly snooping.</P>
<H2>Common TortoiseSVN mistakes</H2>
<P>As mentioned above, TortoiseSVN uses hidden directories to store the Subversion versioning information for that directory and files.&nbsp; So a mistake several of us have made is while working with an existing repository is&nbsp;we use Windows Explorer&nbsp;to copy an existing directory to a new directory (i.e. Theme copying).&nbsp; The problem with this logic is that the hidden svn directories are still there.&nbsp; This causes versioning whoas and most likely will force your updates into the previous version of that directory (or an Update will override your changes without a merge).&nbsp; This is because TortoiseSVN is using the path information stored within the hidden svn folders.</P>
<P>Simple fix really but you have to use your head to remember: Always right-click the new directory after copying, click Search and search for the .svn or _svn directories and delete them.&nbsp; Then the next time you go to check in, the directories will appear to be new to TortoiseSVN and allow you to add them.&nbsp; </P>
<P>An easier&nbsp;fix would be to just use the Rep-browser to perform the action(s), and do an Update when done on your local machine.&nbsp; This will copy/pull down&nbsp;everything properly.</P>
<P>Another common task is if you need to move a directory, as with SGV Client, you will have to move it within the Repo-browser or suffer similar issues noted above.</P>
<P>Bottom-line: use the Repo-browser for most of your copy and/or moving of folders.</P>

<P>And that concludes this four-part series.&nbsp; Lot of reading for just a few options, eh?</P>

<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In other words, the bug in the PostIcon that was introduced with 1.0 release caused a 0.jpg&nbsp;PostIcon to be saved at times and not propertly updating the WeblogPost object.&nbsp; </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">This release, version 1.1, resolves this issue with a&nbsp;performance penalty&nbsp;work-around.&nbsp; But due to the changes and protection in the CSModules, there isn't any other way.&nbsp; The work-around is during a CreatePost event, we don't write the ExtendedAttributes on the PrePost&nbsp;CSModule event&nbsp;(since we do not have the PostID any longer).&nbsp; Instead, I hook into the AfterPost event that fires, after&nbsp;the post has been created, to obtain the PostID.&nbsp; This fires off an UpdatePost method to&nbsp;write the entire post to the DB - again.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Don't worry, this is only during the first&nbsp;initial CreatePost event.&nbsp; If you go back and Update a post, it fires normally&nbsp;- that is&nbsp;only 1 time because we now have a PostID during the PrePost event to write to the ExtendedAttributes.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">I'm open to suggestions if someone else has a cleaner solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;It all comes down to not being able to&nbsp;update/write&nbsp;to the&nbsp;ExtendedAttributes during the AfterPost (PostPost) CSModule event.&nbsp; I've mentioned it for years, there should be a method to save the ExtendedAttributes without having to update the entire object.</SPAN></P>

I apologize - I missed your comment or i would have responded earlier.  Doh.

Alex/Doug:

That is correct.  CS 2007.1 changed a fundimental node in CommunityServer.config from "Modules" to "CSModules".

I need to update the readme for yet another change to CS 2007.1.

Now, there are two different sets of instructions.  CS 2007, use <Modules>.  CS 2007.1, use <CSModules>.

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P><A href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS7xx_E45C/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS700.jpg" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS7xx_E45C/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS700.jpg"><IMG style="BORDER-RIGHT-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-TOP-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM-WIDTH: 0px; BORDER-LEFT-WIDTH: 0px" id=id border=0 alt=HP-Blackbird-vs-Dell-XPS-700 align=right src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS7xx_E45C/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS700_thumb.jpg" width=244 height=145 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS7xx_E45C/HPBlackbirdvsDellXPS700_thumb.jpg"></A> </P>
<P>After <A href="http://webbalert.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://webbalert.com/">Morgan Webb</A> pitched me over to the <A href="http://blackbird.wikia.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://blackbird.wikia.com">Blackbird's Wikia's</A> site about a month ago, I've been keeping an eye out for the specs.&nbsp; Now that I see HP has launched a site about the <A href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/">HP Blackbird 002</A> (love the bassy intro), I am able to compare the HP monster to what I consider it's #1 rival, the <A href="http://www.dell.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell XPS 700 series gaming desktops</A>.&nbsp; Morgan and I have very similar views on many fronts, such as the <A href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/2007/01/27/if-you-watch-ads-you-should-get-free-stuff.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/2007/01/27/if-you-watch-ads-you-should-get-free-stuff.aspx">advertising in PC games</A>, so we dive into latest from HP.</P>
<P>First off, I can not do a direct hardware-to-hardware comparison.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I don't work for Tom's Hardware nor have I received a version of these PCs to review (if Dell/HP is reading this, hollar!).&nbsp; And I simply can't afford to buy both for a personal review.&nbsp; But I do consider myself an ubber elite PC enthusiast since the mid 80s (hey, I was 11 then) hacking the teacher's Apple for better grades.&nbsp; I will try to apply my knowledge to the posted information about each system to more accurately help you make your decision with minimal jargon-talk.</P>
<P><STRONG>A little background info</STRONG> <BR>HP was not the first to the "buy our name-brand performance-PC that you can mod" market.&nbsp; You could be technical and go way back to IBM I owned that was an 4mhz 8086 and boasted as "user upgradable" by allowing for memory chips to be purchased to upgrade it from 512kb to 640kb of total ram.&nbsp; But the dual 5.25" floppy-sized 10 MB HDD was a bit more complicated though. Tip: Use the DOS <A href="http://thestarman.pcministry.com/asm/debug/debug.htm" target=_blank mce_href="http://thestarman.pcministry.com/asm/debug/debug.htm">debug</A> tool as it gave me another 1.20 MB of space by removing the extra space reserved for "bad sector marking".&nbsp; Woot!&nbsp; Ok, too much jargon. </P>
<P>By my recollection, Dell was the first to design, build, and release a fully customizable desktop with gamers and hardcore enthusiasts in mind allowing end-users to modify and upgrade it on their own, if only by their own kits.&nbsp; Heck, they even have <A href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/07/10/17626.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/07/10/17626.aspx">special motherboard upgrade instructional videos</A> and a <A href="http://www.xpsupgradeprogramdell.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.xpsupgradeprogramdell.com">dedicated website</A> for just the upgrade.&nbsp; Obviously, this Dell PC I'm talking about is called the XPS 700 we are looking into here.</P>
<P>What I really like about Dell as a company is that their engineers have released videos and podcasts about this product (and most other products) right at the same time that Dell released their new <A href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/2006/07/09/Dell-gets-down-One2One-with-you.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/archive/2006/07/09/Dell-gets-down-One2One-with-you.aspx">Direct-2-Dell weblog and videoblog</A> back in March 2007.&nbsp; The Direct2Dell site allows engineers to post thoughts, product descriptions, videos, and even customer service responses for just about anything Dell - and receive feedback directly from you on the subject matter.&nbsp; This is a first for an industry that seems to hide behind technical support to filter feedback to customer service and engineers, if it even gets that far. </P>
<P>Anyhoot, no I am not sponsored by Dell.&nbsp; Nor am I affiliated in any way with Dell, for the most part.&nbsp; My previous employer and I built the Direct2Dell blog site, so I am a little partial to Dell in that regard as I haven't seen any similar manufacturers doing the same.&nbsp; That, and I thought it was pretty freakin' cool of them.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Dell XPS 700</STRONG> <BR>Getting back to the topic at hand, the Dell XPS 700 series comes in two flavors: The XPS 700 and XPS 700H2O (water cooled).&nbsp; The 720 series now available includes support for quad-core processors as noted on <A href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2058399,00.asp" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2058399,00.asp">ExtremeTech</A> and is also available as a "Motherboard Upgrade" kit for earlier 700 series consumers.&nbsp; Yes, I'm plugging another larger community site I did wanting the recognition for our new web design and consulting company, <A href="http://colorburn.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://colorburn.com/">Colorburn</A>, specializing in CommunityServer large communities.&nbsp; Ok, no more plugs - I promise.</P>
<P>The XPS 700 series is pretty sleek.&nbsp; Instead of trying to define or describe this unit, I believe Dell's videoblog does the best job without me having to interpret their information <A href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/84.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/84.aspx">here</A> and <A href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/79.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/05/79.aspx">here</A> (the first video really shows it's size!), amongst the dozens of other posts from their <A href="http://direct2dell.com/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=XPS" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=XPS">engineers here</A>, that yes you can provide direct feedback to.&nbsp; It's quite a beast, to say the least.</P>
<P>The one thing that struck me about the Dell XPS was how they actually encourage users to overclock, upgrade, and interchange parts.&nbsp; As time went on, I see the parts are mostly sold in "Upgrade Kits" from Dell such as newer proprietary motherboard and CPU combos.&nbsp; But still you can go throw in any newer PCIe 16x video card and CPU, and have a Core2 Duo system running&nbsp;over 1400mhz bus in no time.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>HP Blackbird 002</STRONG> <BR>No, I don't consider the Blackbird with it's Core 2 Extreme Duo Quad Core an <A href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/588016/sr_71_blackbird/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.metacafe.com/watch/588016/sr_71_blackbird/">SR-71 Blackbird</A> (ah yes, a nice <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088979/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088979/">D.A.R.Y.L.</A> flashback).&nbsp; It really is a serious machine.&nbsp; But in the world of videoblogging, I find myself scanning for text to read more and viewing a photo gallery.&nbsp; Eh, Dell has spoiled me.</P>
<P>Reading about the motherboard and their "<A href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/history/" target=_blank mce_href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/history/">Voodoo process of elimination</A>", it seems they are going to be selling a rig with a custom mobo that's not interchangeable - just like the Dell.&nbsp; You can supply as many PCI and PCIe slots as you want to.&nbsp; These days, most things are built onto the motherboards now which you just end up swapping out every few years any ways.&nbsp; But given both the HP and Dell's mobos seem to be proprietary, maybe having these extra slots is a good thing so you can install the next-generation sound card when it's invented (since <A href="http://www.creative.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.creative.com/">Creative's</A> last effort, the X-Fi, didn't take off as they hoped it would).</P>
<P>I was impressed with the Blackbird with its built-in RAID5 for storage.&nbsp; Any storage junkie knows that RAID5 provides more throughput then a single HDD, and a RAID1 setup is dirt-slow.&nbsp; Dell's XPS only comes in RAID1 or RAID0 flavors (RAID0 being the fastest, yes, but not redundant).&nbsp; My only issue is there is no cache memory for the raid system (that I can see listed).&nbsp; As with the cache on CPUs, this makes all the difference in RAID setups and it's why I would stick to my Areca PCIe setup for a RAID solution.</P>
<P>Only time will tell (when released) if the Blackbird is truly an upgradable piece.&nbsp; If they offer "Motherboard Kits" such as the ones from Dell to keep their end-users happy by upgrading to the latest mobo/cpu combinations, then it really will give Dell a run for their money (serious money that is).</P>
<P><STRONG>Taking the plunge</STRONG> <BR>Both Dell and HP have developed amazing systems that can be bumped to some pretty high FSB and memory speeds with very little work.&nbsp; But what both will require instead is a decent credit score to be able to afford it.&nbsp; Yes that's right folks, these "user serviceable" PCs are not cheap.&nbsp; But on the flip side, they aren't overly expensive either such as the recent <A href="http://www.alienware.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.alienware.com">AlienWare</A> units these days.&nbsp; Now I love AlienWare so don't flame me, but over the recent years they have moved to more of a "pay for our designer brand (cases)" instead of worrying about end-user affordability of super high-end PCs like they were in the past.&nbsp; My preferred HP Blackbird setup looks to be around $6500, while the matching Dell is $6100.&nbsp; But when pricing a comparable AlienWare, it came to $7100 - which is amazing if you consider that <A href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1941376,00.asp" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1941376,00.asp">AlienWare is now owned by Dell</A>.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Maybe it's similar to a Cadillac Escalade vs a Chevy Tahoe: one's decked out a lot more when compared to Dell's base desktops.&nbsp; But Dell now has the XPS 700 systems that directly competes with AlienWare's recent offerings.&nbsp; Maybe the XPS 700s are using the same base perhaps?&nbsp; But I don't see AlienWare boasting "Motherboard Upgrade" kits, so I'd have to say no to that theory and sway more towards the XPS systems that allows you to upgrade.</P>
<P><STRONG>Water cooling</STRONG> <BR>I'm not going into the whole liquid-cooling debate and trying to sell you on it, but just wanted to note a few advantages.&nbsp; Water is one of the best heat conductors, exchanging heat quite quickly and efficiently.&nbsp; With this idea in mind, the PC overclocking world developed into an industry requiring a good heat exchanger while keeping the volume down on the fans.&nbsp; Any chemistry expert can reaffirm you that by blasting water onto a water block made of copper or silver allows the heat to transfer to the water quite efficiently and away from the water block.&nbsp; Then all you have to do is move the water to a radiator to remove the heat.</P>
<P><A href="http://www.ocforums.com/showthread.php?p=3243098" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.ocforums.com/showthread.php?p=3243098">In my rig</A> which was my first H2O experiment (I know, late to the party), it turned out to be quite amazing.&nbsp; It's near-silent operation at 1200mhz FSB with my theory of "bigger is better" is achieved by simply using an extremely large and oversized radiator (oversized as it's just for the CPU and FSB), with three large (and quiet) fans spinning at the slowest speed possible (@ 4.4v).&nbsp; Most watercooling gurus use a small radiator just the size of a single fan, which usually requires the fan to run at full 12v speed.&nbsp; That's just too loud for me.</P>
<P>I mention watercooling as Dell's XPS 700 series actually has it as an option, where the HP Blackbird comes with a sealed unit from the get-go.&nbsp; HP is actually claiming they are the "<A href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/thermals/" target=_blank mce_href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/thermals/">first performance-PC manufacturer to effectively implement liquid-cooling</A>".&nbsp; I find this hard to swallow looking at AlienWare (considered a manufacturer as of 2005 when they got away from off-the-shelve mobos), and even Dell earlier this year with their XPS 700H2O series.&nbsp; Now I will give HP mucho props for making it sealed and never needing service.&nbsp; That is what they should have focused on in their claims.&nbsp; </P>
<P>But given my research in the past, no "H2O kit" can hold a candle (heat - phun intended) to your own custom made setup.&nbsp; The effort required though, is a whole other story.&nbsp; Refer to <A href="http://www.ocforums.com/" mce_href="http://www.ocforums.com">www.ocforums.com</A> if you want to take that path of the dark side (by far the best site for information on H2O I found years ago).</P>
<P><STRONG>Conclusion <BR></STRONG>The Dell XPS with it's Core 2 Extreme QX68xx 8MB overclocked quad core available is close to the same cost as the HP Blackbird when it comes down to it with dual nVidia 8800 SLIs and LCD.</P>
<P>But I have to lean towards Dell with their <A href="http://direct2dell.com/" target=_blank mce_href="http://direct2dell.com/">Direct2Dell</A> videoblog and engineer's playground of fishing for feedback to their products, where I feel I can be <EM>influential</EM>.&nbsp; Where is HP's Direct2HP website so I can provide my comments to their engineers?&nbsp; Is that what the <A title=http://blackbird.wikia.com href="http://blackbird.wikia.com/" mce_href="http://blackbird.wikia.com">blackbird.wikia.com</A> website is for?&nbsp; This website doesn't seem to be geared towards feedback for HP's newest player to the market and looks more like an open blog.</P>
<P>I really want to get away from what Ms. Webb describes as "spending hours and hours with the same old issues" by building, maintaining, and upgrading my own hardware.&nbsp; I have to look at the cost I would spend to get a comparable PC from HP/Dell that I could build one for.&nbsp; So it comes down to, is your time worth a few grand to spend on saving you the time of building these PCs and upgrading?&nbsp; I can argue both sides of the equation, but only you can answer it for yourself.&nbsp; Hardcore builders will not be swayed by the Blackbird, nor Dell, and will continue to build for less.&nbsp; Much less.</P>
<P>But then again looking back at the time and effort it took to get my rig up to snuff, I really could have used those several months for something else to make up the cost for one of these XPS 700s or Blackbirds.&nbsp; Humm, I do need a new PC soon...</P>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Good write up Eric. I got sucked into the new iMacs and thought, "Apple is the way to go!". Then I remembered backing up and the Mac Pro was my choice with Boot Camp. Then I heard about the Blackbird and said yes. I had budgeted 6 to 7K for two new computers for the house. Like usual this project has grown. 

1. First it was the iMac 24" with 2.8ghz
2. Then it was the Mac Pro 2.66ghz and x1900 card with a few drives and 30" monitor
3. Then the Blackbird with 30" monitor
4. Then Dell XPS with different configs ending around 4k plus monitor

Now I sit and read. I wait for Leopard. I wait till later in Oct. I will stay windows. We have 4 laptops and all run great on windows.

My son is the only gamer. I edit videos, picts, web sites and do business on computer. I may try some games like Bio Shock. Looks interesting. However I prefer my dirt bike, surf board, mtn bike, skis, road bike, etc to staying inside. But weather will be taking the turn soon in CA and maybe I will make games a new adventure.

I want to get something fast and sweet. My two computers is gone. Just one system. If I wait (I know things getter faster and cheaper) I can get get a decent system. I think late Oct early Nov.

The laptops do the job just fine right now. But boy the 24 and 30 inch monitors are sweet! 

Doug

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Why the Inspiron is a King]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p>I step away from the system, hands nearly numb, being reminded again since 4 years why PCs will always out perform the latest consoles such as the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. As I finish a two hour session of Battlefield 2 with my old buddies from <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.tcunit.com/" href="http://www.tcunit.com/">TCU</a>, I can't help but to be amazed at the new found graphics tonight I have not seen before because my previous systems could not handle HDTV and full graphics.</p><h6 align="center"><a target="_blank" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590.png" href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590.png"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Battlefield2, 1920x1200x32, Ultra-High Hack, ~89 FPS " width="644" height="404" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590_thumb.png" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/BF22007120815524590_thumb.png"></a> </h6>
<p align="center"><b>Battlefield2, 1920x1200x32, Ultra-High Hack, ~89 FPS</b> </p>

<p>Stepping back, a bit dumb-founded, I question my sanity in the PC I just built tonight. I justify it quickly when I consider the tiny investment it took to bring this desktop to be the game-crushing machine it is now.&nbsp; Only this time it is not my 4.2 Ghz 1200mhz FSB desktop - it's my $900 Dell Inspiron E1705 work laptop that I spent $240 upgrading. 
</p><p>I have been a long-time advocate for Dell machines back from my IT Administrator days in Atlanta at CASE Masters and iDealmusic.&nbsp; Dell laptops in particular have had an interesting reign.&nbsp; Back in 1998, <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.pcmag.com" href="http://www.pcmag.com">PC Magazine</a> started to issue the "Drop Test" against the leading laptops.&nbsp; Being dropped from six feet, all laptops failed to boot up except one - the Dell Latitude series which was a business-class unit.&nbsp; It was my first laptop I bought, and still have it.&nbsp; I was using it all the way up to 2005, lastly for automotive tuning. 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Dell Inspiron E1705/9400 Exploded View " width="470" height="585" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/exploded_view.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/exploded_view.jpg"> <br><b>Dell Inspiron E1705/9400 Exploded View</b> (source: support.dell.com) </p>

<p>This story starts with the Dell Inspiron E1705 or also known as the 9400.&nbsp; Dell has done something great here, a laptop that is user-serviceable and user-upgradable.&nbsp; Yes it is a discontinued laptop, but if I only have know when I had it back at Telligent there would have been some serious modding going on.&nbsp; Tonight, I ventured into wild with a few components and upgrades not normally available.&nbsp; Each one has its own story to tell. 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="E1705, 4 GB SDRAM, nVidia FX2500 7900GTX 512MB, Arctic Silver 5 " width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0004.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0004.jpg"> <br><b>E1705, 4 GB SDRAM, nVidia FX2500 7900GTX 512MB, Arctic Silver 5</b> </p>
<h3>4 GB SDRAM PC2-5400 667mhz</h3>
<p>The first thing many will cry fowl on here is, "The Inspiron E1705/9400 does not support 4GB of ram."&nbsp; This is untrue.&nbsp; While yes the bios only sees 3.25 GB available, so does the M17xx XPS systems and many desktop motherboards.&nbsp; There are lots of theories to this, but the truth is that your peripherals reserve that memory space and Windows allows them to over 3 GB - even if they never will use it.&nbsp; Basically, they are powered but never used.&nbsp; Using PAE causes some mobo/bios combinations to free up that address block to 4 GB, allowing for up 4.5 GB to be used.&nbsp; But the sad fact is there isn't much you can do right now when it's restricted at the hardware level.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Me?&nbsp; I figured it was a good $61 investment for my next laptop to have 4 GB as well.&nbsp; :) 
</p><h3>nVidia quadro FX2500m 512MB, 7900GTX GPU, PCI-E CAD and Gaming Card</h3>
<p>Another thing many will deny is the ability to stick an XPS or M90 "high-end" design cad and/or gaming card into the 'low-end" Inspiron business-class line.&nbsp; As you can see below, this is not the case either and the installation is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; The M90 designer-cad graphics card is the nVidia FX2500m quadro, which is a modified version of the 7900 GTX 512 MB (from my research).&nbsp; 
</p><p>The forum gurus are spending $350 to $500 on this particular card.&nbsp; I snagged mine from eBay for $160.&nbsp; The theory here was if it truly performs as well as the desktop version, then I can finally, after 4 years of planning, downgrade my PC to our Vista MCE machine in the main room and move to the laptop full-time (mobile again!).&nbsp; That is precisely what the PC was built for, less the water-cooling rig which actually is built to handle the heat demands for the next 5 to 7 years of CPUs.&nbsp; So bring 'em on! 
</p><h3>Dell 150w PA15 Power Adapter</h3>
<p>Most Dells these days come with an 90w.&nbsp; While this one sufficed for the first few hours of gaming, I did notice the unit getting much hotter than normal.&nbsp; Others amongst the net have mentioned that a 130w or 150w is needed because the 90w will burn out with these upgrades.&nbsp; So I ordered an original Dell PA15 new in box from eBay for $20.&nbsp; I needed a 2nd adapter anyhow.&nbsp; But be warned - they don't call these things a "brick" for no reason.&nbsp; This thing is literally the size of a brick! 
</p><h3>Overclocking</h3>
<p>I do not think I will be overclocking, but yes it is true.&nbsp; People are dramatically <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.notebookforums.com/forum153.html" href="http://www.notebookforums.com/forum153.html">overclocking their Dell</a> laptops.&nbsp; At this time the E1705's CPU, bus, and memory can not be overclocked (except the memory timings).&nbsp; But the GPU (graphics processor unit) can be if it is the nVidia series, and quite extensively too! 
</p><h3>Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Paste</h3>
<p>I only mention this because the other gurus on the forums have been putting this into their systems for the CPU upgrades.&nbsp; I have used AS5 for many years now, and I swear by it.&nbsp; My 4.2 Ghz desktop machine idles @ 28C and peaks at 37C with both cores maxed.&nbsp; That is just amazing (plus the water cooling). 
</p><p>So in this venture I decided to break out the old tube from the freezer and slap a dab on the CPU.&nbsp; The result was more than I expected with only 15 minutes of work, and well worth it.&nbsp; So let us begin the photo slide show with commen[dy]tary. 
</p><p>I was browsing one day and wanted a temperature reader for my laptop as I was noticing the fans kicking on high and the keyboard running quite hot at times.&nbsp; I stumbled upon <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.notebookforums.com/" href="http://www.notebookforums.com/">Notebook Forums</a> and was amazed at the level of upgrades people have done to their laptops from all brands.&nbsp; It seems the manufacturers have finally gave up and allowed end-users the ability to upgrade their machines.&nbsp; You can read up on your brand there.

<p><b><font size="4">Preface</font></b></p>

<p>This post is not meant to be a complete guide to installing the hardware.&nbsp; Instead it is more of a visual verification cue of some modifications (read cutting) that you must do.&nbsp; Check out Dell's support page and view/download the <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/en/manuals?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs" href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/en/manuals?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs">service manual</a> as it has very detailed, step-by-step instructions to opening and servicing your laptop. </p>

<p><b><font size="4">So now let us break this thing open...</font></b></p>

<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Hinge Cover Removed " width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0005.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0005.jpg"> <br><b>Hinge Cover Removed</b> </p>

<p>First thing the service manual says is to remove the hinge cover as shown above.&nbsp; It was a bit nerve racking to pry that hard on a piece of plastic, and having it pop - sounding like I was breaking each and every tab.&nbsp; Being the first step in the entire process, I did have a reservation.&nbsp; But pushed on, prying harder, knowing it would come off cause the manual said so.&nbsp; 
</p><p>This is the most difficulty step.&nbsp; Get past the cracking, creaking, and popping sounds and you are home free. 
</p><p>Tip: If you do not have a plastic scribe, you can use a small/tiny flat-head screwdriver but do not pry up as the manual says because this will scratch the white plastic.&nbsp; Instead, use a twisting motion to pop the panel up and loose at the location of the red arrow.&nbsp; Then slowly work your way around the corner, twisting and popping the rest loose.&nbsp; Once you can get your finger under it, pull up and don't be scared. 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Keyboard Removed, ATI visible " width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0007.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0007.jpg"> <br><b>Keyboard Removed, ATI visible</b> </p>

<p>Next comes the keyboard.&nbsp; Nothing special here.&nbsp; I just wanted to show you the first glimpse of the ATI X1400 video card to be removed. 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Dell 1500 802.11n WiFi card and Antenna Leads " width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0008.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0008.jpg"> <br><b>Dell 1500 802.11n WiFi card and Antenna Leads</b> </p>

<p>Skipping ahead, along the way of removing the LCD panel it says to disconnect the wireless antenna of your wireless card.&nbsp; Here you can see the antenna leads connected to the Dell 1500 802.11n card via the red arrows.&nbsp; There is some questions on the web to even having to do this step if you do not have a wifi card.&nbsp; The answer is yes, they are just connected to dummy terminals. 
</p><p>And yes, if you put things back together and have no signal on your wifi card - you forgot to connect these! 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="LCD Panel Removed " width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0009.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0009.jpg"> <br><b>LCD Panel Removed</b> </p>

<p>With the LCD removed, you've passed the point of no return (or now you are fully committed rather).&nbsp; 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Magnetized Screwdriver Helps " width="644" height="430" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0013.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0013.jpg"> <br><b>Magnetized Screwdriver Helps</b> </p>

<p>This shows a little trick I have been using since I was a younglin'.&nbsp; I have a special set of tools that are magnetized, allowing me to remove (as shown) and install screws in very difficult places.&nbsp; Tools like this screwdriver pulls the screw right out, not having to flip over the system and let them drop and bounce. 
</p><p>It is very easy to magnetize your existing screwdrivers.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Mr._Wizard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_Mr._Wizard">Mr. Wizard</a> showed me how when I was just a kid, and I have been doing it every since.&nbsp; Simply take a strong magnet and place it on the tip.&nbsp; Now slide it down the shaft, away from the tip in only one direction - do not twist the magnet around the shaft.&nbsp; This polarizes the shaft with the electrons that were resting at one end now oppositely charged at the other end of the shaft (because you moved the magnet).&nbsp; You can also de-magnetize by reversing precisely what you just did (place the magnet at the far end, and slide it towards the tip).&nbsp; This does not always work because you need to be using the same pole (North or South) of the magnet that when you started.&nbsp; Using the opposite pole will not have much effect.&nbsp; 
</p><p>Do not worry.&nbsp; Just slide the magnet down the shaft and be done.&nbsp; And do not magnetize all of your tools.&nbsp; Just two or three select screwdrivers, and keep them away from your other tools so they do not magnetize others.&nbsp; Note that I highly recommend the use of <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/770f/" href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/science/770f/">rare-Earth magnets</a> as they are extremely strong. 
</p><p>And before you ask, yes I removed the HDD before using tools that were magnetized. 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Above: nVidia quadro FX2500m, Below: ATI X1400" width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0015.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0015.jpg"> <br><b>Above: nVidia quadro FX2500m, Below: ATI X1400</b></p>

<p align="left">Here is the view of the ATI X1400 still in the system and the new nVidia FX2500m for comparison.&nbsp; Notice there is no heat pipe on the left side of the ATI card, only the right side.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Above: ATI X1400, Below: nVidia FX2500m " width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0020.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0020.jpg"> <br><b>Above: ATI X1400, Below: nVidia FX2500m</b> </p>

<p>Here you can see both cards and really see what others are calling "dual heat pipes" on the nVidia 7900 GTX (below). 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Modifying the case to fit the FX2500m" width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0021.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0021.jpg"> <br><b>Modifying the case to fit the FX2500m</b> </p>

<p>Now for the point of no return.&nbsp; To get the nVidia FX2500m to fit, you will need to modify the left-rear area of the laptop case behind the CPU's heatsink.&nbsp; This is because the left heatsink for the FX2500m is too wide to fit into this area.&nbsp; So you have to grind down or break off the two plastic sides/tabs.&nbsp; You can see in this photo above that I am grabbing one of the tabs to break off with a pair of needle-nose pliers. 
</p><p>Another option that would keep your full warranty would be to modify the FX2500m's heatsink by grinding down the two ends.&nbsp; I believe this would fit well with slight bending on the copper pipe to raise the heatsink about 1/8".&nbsp; This does not block air-flow for the cpu's heatsink, and still is vented to the rear outlet.&nbsp; Alas I do not have a grinder here, or I would have done it myself. 
</p><p>Do not worry about warranty here.&nbsp; If you are going this far, then you have the ability to service the laptop yourself if a component fails during your warranty period.&nbsp; Dell's "low cost" warranty is parts-only, and there ya go.&nbsp; Dell will send you the parts to replace, which you can service it yourself - under warranty.&nbsp; Just I would not take the chance of sending the entire laptop in for repair as they may catch the broken tabs. 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Right Tab Modified" width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0024.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0024.jpg"> <br><b>Right Tab Modified</b></p>

<p>You can see above it does not take very much.&nbsp; Test fit the FX2500m a few times though to make sure you removed enough.

<p>While I had my system apart, I made plans to upgrade the CPU's cooling a little with a touch of Arctic Silver 5 as I noted above.&nbsp; You can see in this photo above the crap that Dell (and most PC makers) use on their CPUs.&nbsp; Mine had actually turned into a brittle paste. 
</p><p align="center"><a target="_blank" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026.jpg" href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Cleaned CPU and Northbridge" width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026_thumb.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0026_thumb.jpg"></a> <br><b>Cleaned CPU and Northbridge</b> <br>(CLICK FOR JPEG COMPRESSED 1.43 MB FULL-RES PICTURE FOR DETAIL/CLOSE-UP)</p>

<p>Before you can apply AS5, you must thoroughly clean both surfaces (the CPU and heatsink).&nbsp; My best experiences has always been to use rubbing alcohol with some lint-free clothes or even kitchen paper towels.&nbsp; AS5 works smaller than you can see, filling the microscopic gaps and imperfections of the two pieces.&nbsp; Above you can see how the CPU's surface is now mirror-like, reflecting the white water-bottle cap.&nbsp; 
</p><p>The copper heatpipe was another story though.&nbsp; It was extremely rough and the paste was near-impossible to remove.&nbsp; Sorry I forgot to snap a photo of my work, because of the time involved I was just in a hurry to get it polished down.&nbsp; But I ended up using 400grit sandpaper, than 1000grit, and 2000grit to get a near-polished surface.&nbsp; You do not have to do any of this to your heatpipe though.&nbsp; Just get it cleaned off. 
</p><p>I went this route of applying AS5 and polishing my heatpipe because I did not like my CPU's temps under normal conditions just idling and/or working.&nbsp; I wanted to cool down the 62C idle of my CPU!&nbsp; I am proud to say that using AS5 did the trick.&nbsp; My idle temps are down to 37C with ambient about 74F.&nbsp; For comparison, my 4.2 Ghz desktop noted above idles at 28C but that's not fair given the custom cooling I did with it.&nbsp; But, it's close! 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="CPU heatpipe and new (used) FX2500m all installed " width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0028.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0028.jpg"> <br><b>CPU heatpipe and new (used) FX2500m all installed</b> </p>

<p>Here is a shot of everything re-installed and tightened down.&nbsp; Note in comparison to a photo above of the ATI X1400 in the system.

<p>Now this was something I was not happy about.&nbsp; There is a large gap from the left fan (fan 1) to the CPU's heatsink from before.&nbsp; Then there was now a gap between the CPU and GPU's heatsinks.&nbsp; You can see in the picture above the screwdriver that is clearly visible (click the image for the full-res version).</p>

<p>In my history of custom cooling back in the 80s and 90s, there is one thing I learned that always remains constant: airflow is key.&nbsp; So my task would be to modify the airflow to force all air through the heatsinks by not allowing any to escape the airflow path through any gaps. 
</p><p align="center"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="Aluminum Foil Shrouds" width="644" height="431" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0031.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/IMG_0031.jpg"> <br><b>Aluminum Foil Shrouds</b></p>

<p>I accomplished this by using a few pieces of kitchen aluminum foil, scotch-tape, and additional AS5.&nbsp; There are multiple reasons for this.&nbsp; First for safety I evaluated the entire area and found no electrical components or circuit boards anywhere near this area.&nbsp; You do not want a piece coming loose and short-circuiting things!&nbsp; </p>

<p>Second is having aluminum foil allows the heat to transfer from one copper pipe to the other (just a tad though, too thin really to do a massive amount).&nbsp; That may not have been the best idea at first because CPUs usually run cooler than GPUs from my overclocking experience.&nbsp; But considering how freakin' high my CPU temps were before I even began, I could only see this as helping to offload some heat to the GPU's heatpipe - even if just a tad amount, anything had to help. 
</p><p>I also closed down the air escaping on the left side of fan's outlet to the CPU's heatsink, as well as the gaps between the two heatsinks.&nbsp; Now all air is forced by the fan trough the CPU heatsink, and then through the GPU's heatsink where it than only has room to exit the back vent. 
</p><p align="center"><a mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle.jpg" href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="CPU idle at 36C using Arctic Silver 5, down from 62C when OEM" width="644" height="484" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle_thumb.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/idle_thumb.jpg"></a>&nbsp;<br><b>CPU idle at 36C using Arctic Silver 5, down from 62C when OEM</b></p>

<p>It is very well worth it, even if I did not upgrade the GPU, because now my CPU temps are a steady 37C with fans set to low.&nbsp; With no fans, it creeps up to 47C.&nbsp; Compare that to the 62C idle before with fans on high, and I think I came out ahead.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="center"><a mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95.jpg" href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0px;" border="0" alt="CPU cores pegged reaches 72C after 30 minutes of stress-testing, down from much much higher" width="639" height="484" mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95_thumb.jpg" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/WhytheInspironisaKing_13F13/Prime95_thumb.jpg"></a>&nbsp;<br><b>CPU cores pegged reaches 72C after 30 minutes of stress-testing, down from much much higher</b></p>

<p>And for you guys into max CPU heat testing, using an instance of Prime95 on each core yields a max temp of 72C with 74F ambient after about 30 minutes.&nbsp; Much better than before!&nbsp; I will admit I did not pay a lot of attention to the max temp before the AS5 was applied.&nbsp; Let us just say I did not stress it for very long once it climbed to 85C.</p>

<p>While gaming the GPU hovered around 63 to 65C tonight after about two hours, and peaked at 70C just for an instant. I would have applied AS5 to the GPU's heatsink but I did not have a torx-bit small enough (it was missing from my collection) and I wanted to get my laptop running again after spending that time sanding down the CPU's heatpipe. 
</p><p>In conclusion, I feel this was very much worth the effort.&nbsp; A few hours of research over a few days time, finding a great deal on the video card, and planning/preparation before hand, and it all took about 3 hours from start to end (including the sanding of the CPU's heatpipe).&nbsp; 
</p><p>Not a bad system for under $1,200 with BF2 averaging in Fraps at 85 FPS and BF2142 around 78 FPS steady.&nbsp; Why someone would pay for an XPS system is beyond me.&nbsp; Just get an Inspiron for a good price, hunt around after a few months find a deal on the upgrade parts.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now, if I can get my hands on one of those newer 1720/1730s with dual HDD bays... </p>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi,

I just got the E1705 for Christmas. It only had 1GB of RAM, so I ordered another 1GB to max it out. I was searching Google for a hint as to what tools I'd need when I stumbled onto your site. Cool!

I haven't been so much into the H/W side of things for the past 10 years or so as I got more into software and the business side of things.

As an application developer/DBA, I could use a notebook with 4GB. That was the real downer for me. I did get it NIB for $875 from a guy in San Jose. 

Are there two banks with two slots? I don't understand what you are saying regarding 2GB & 4GB. Does the 9400/E1705 mobo support it, but it isn't implemented, or can you just mod the BIOS to recognize 4 x 1GB SDRAM DIMMs?

A bit confused,

Thanx

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey Brad:

I'm a former Atlantan myself.  :)

There are two SDRAM memory slots in the E1705.  So to achieve 4GB of ram, you will need two 2GB SDRAM sticks (for laptops).

The issue with a lot of bios' out there (desktops, laptops, and even the XPS-line of previous laptops) is that they do not allow full access to all 4096 MB of ram - if you were to stick in 4GB of ram.  The E1705 is one of them, and limits you to utilizing only 3.2 GB of ram available to the OS.

No, there is no bios hack either as even the XPS that supported 4GB of ram, did the same thing.

I myself am a DBA/Coder by trade, and need every bit of ram I can muster.  So $80 was a good investment for two 2GB memory sticks for me, so I can get 3.2 GB for now.  Hopefully my next laptop will support 4 GB of ram, and I can just transfer the memory over.  

Hope that helps!
-Eric]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Nice work Eric, I just did the same exact thing today.  I bought the 150w power supply, the thermal paste, and the quadro 2500m.  I installed everything just fine but when I booted up some problems arose.  After a few minutes, lines or artifacts appeared on the screen.  Nothing was overheating and everything seemed fine except for the artifacts, or lines on the screen. Later on I was just browsing and my computer froze on me. I restarted and tried playing Quake III, a not hardware demanding game. Less than 10 mins into the game lots of artifacts appeared and within the minute the entire image was scrambled up and nothing was recognizable and it froze again.   After all this it froze on me again when i was looking at my desktop and so i restarted and all there was was a black screen. I finally took the quadro out and put in my old video card and everything worked fine.  I was using windows vista ultimate with all this.  What do you think could be the cause of this? Is it possible that I was sent a bad video card??  Do you know if the quadro 2500m has any issues with Windows Vista?  Which OS did you have the 2500m on?  Thank You very much, Ervin]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Ervin : I do not believe it is the video card, as I had the EXACT same thing happen to me!

It's directly the video card drivers for the 7900.  And believe me when I say the drivers are much harder to find then you think.  

Do not go to www.nvidia.com and download the latest for the 2500m.  They do not work (I never thought I'd see the day where nvidia.com's drivers did NOT work!).

Do not install the latest driver from Windows Vista Updates.

What you want to do is download a special "hacked" set.  It's basically the highend drivers from nvidia "desktop only" series of cards (laptops have lower-end versions).  But with a slight tweak to the INI files to allow you to install it for your 2500m Quatra mobile edition.  That's it.

www.laptopvideo2go.com <- You want to bookmark this site for future nVidia-powered laptops.

These are the ones I specifically have installed for Vista 32bit (64bit as well).  But they have released newer versions as well.

http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=16545

NOTE: I went directly to the forums and researched precisely which driver I needed.  You can try the homepage drivers, but I didn't pick the right one.  Going to the forums I immediately found the ones I needed.

It took me a while to find them.  Uninstalling, installing, uninstalling, cleaning, etc.  Artifacts I had constantly.  Until I found those drivers above.

Now, everything is perfect!]]></content>

Eric here has provided us with information as to what drivers have been tested and work.  Do not use the drivers from dell or any like that.  Like Eric said, you have to use the drivers from laptopvideo2go.com.  the driver version that ive come across from other forums has been 169.04 and Eric is using 169.25 which he has found to be working. you just have to make sure to use the modded inf file otherwise the driver wont install.  ]]></content>

Same in windows.  If I allow windows to automatically install drivers, it picks the 7900 drivers, however, if I force install 2500m drivers (reguardless of which ones I use) there are no errors or problems.

I'm wondering if the system is actually taking advantage of the card even though it's not reporting it correctly and if there's a way to get it to do so.

Any thoughts?]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Bryan Fusco: Did you happen to snap a picture of the card's part number, or write it down?

There is a 256MB version of the 7900 called a "GTS" or "GT".  The "GTX" is the only version that is 512 MB.

It's not windows reporting 256mb, it's the driver that talks to the card - and what the card is actually reporting back to the driver, to the OS.

I suspect you got a 7900 GS version.  What's the eBay link?  Perhaps he was selling it thinking it was a GTX (and falsely advertised if so).

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[You said "This story starts with the Dell Inspiron E1705 or also known as the 9300/9400". I got so excited with the prospect of putting a 7900GTX in my 9300/XPS --till i did some more reading. It doesn't look like its at all possible to put that gpu into the 9300/Xps gen2, because the 9400/E1705 uses a different mobo, and the discontinued XPS gen2 never had a 7900 option. The 6800ultra/7800GTX swap works on the 9300, because its the same board as the XPS gen2, which had the 7800 as an option. I would like to be wrong about this, so if anyone has found a way to make this work, please let me know...]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Firestarter: The E1705/9300/9400 never came with the 7800 or 7900 or 7950 either!  That's the purpose of this post, to show that you can swap them in - with a little case modification.

As a matter of fact, the 7800/7900/7950s we (the E1705 guys) are sourcing for our swaps actually come from the 9400 XPS systems!  :)

Another fact that I think would help you is that the 7800GTX is the identicle physicaly card (identicle as in where it mounts, the heatsink pipe locations, etc) as the 7900 and 7950 cards!  

With that said, since you said the 7800 swap is an option - I would bet $20 (your shipping fee to send it back if it doesn't) that the 7900 and 7950s would fit as well.  :)  

They are the same physical card as to where it mounts, and the heat sinks.  I see no reason why it would not.  The mobo's BIOS doesn't care, nor does Windows. 

Good luck and let us know!

Ps - I am working on an overhaul of my blog, to make reading/replying to these much either.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi Eric,
Thanks loads, I just bought today 4gb of memory and a 250GB HDD to put in my inspiron 9400, I was really baffled over this memory issue and your information has been great.
Now that I can see you can upgrade the graphics card, I am really excited - I don't need to buy a new laptop!!!!
Quick question to clarify:
1. You have put in a fx2500 nvidia card. Am I right in saying I could buy the 7800/7900/7950 and do the same procedure as you have done?
If Yes, which card would you recommend if I was purely gaming or using programs heavy on rendering like after effects etc?
2. You mentioned something about HDD too - is there anyway to like replace the CD/DVD drive for a swappable HDD?

Thanks in advance - you are the man!

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@blatta: Could you clarify what problem you are having when upgrading the card?  We need more information.  :)

@McMood:
1) Yes, any of them will work.  And fyi, 7800=fx1500, 7900=fx2500, and the 7950=fx3500.  Make sure to get the "FX2500/FX3500" models.  The 1500 is not worth it.  And make sure it says FX2500 or 3500.  There's a 7900 series card out there that is only 256 MB (see comments from others above, and I have private emails stating as such).  That "7900" series is not an FX2500.  Make sure you search and get the FX2500!

The FX3500 is the premium card, with just a tad higher FPS over the 2500.  I saw the several hundred-dollar difference and said, "The FX2500 is good enough for me!"

Search eBay.  I got mine for $170.  And I've seen them as high as $400 on eBay for the 2500.  :)  

2) Not that I am aware of.  With 16 GB memory sticks available (especially that fit in your built-in SD Card slot), I don't see why you would.

The 1720/1730s is what has the dual-HDD features built-in.  Our 1705s sadly do not have this.

Just to clarify there is no difference between a fx2500 quadro and a 7900gtx card? I always thought the M90 dell precision series had the quadro cards as they were geared to industry/research related programs and the 7900gtx series were made for gaming enthusiasts.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Actually that is incorrect.  What I was trying to say is the FX2500m Quattro "uses" the 7900GTX chipset, but with 512MB of ram though.  The standard 7900GTX card available only has 256MB of ram, and is not a quatro nor a FX2500.  I was only mentioning "7900=FX2500" to let u know it used the same chipset, and to search/Google/ebay for the "FX2500" or "FX3500", not the term "7900".  

Sorry for the confusion.  And no apology needed, as it seems I wasn't clear enough (I apology).  Shouldn't have said that.

Bottomline, only search for FX2500/FX3500.  Don't search for 7900s for sale.]]></content>

Does the external port work on an external monitor?  If so, it could be the ribbon cable for the LCD not secured.  

Beyond that, there isn't much you can do to test a used fx2500 without installing it into yet another machine.  

If you revert back to your old card and everything works, it just may be the video card.  

And nope, a 90W shouldn't matter for normal use.  Only intense 3D gaming is when u need a larger PSU (and even the 90W can work to a small degree in that, but it does get extremely hot under load).  But for normal booting and browsing/development, the 90w is fine (it's what I am using all of this time.  the 150w is in the bag, for gaming times).

Thanks for the reply, by the ribbon cable for the LCD do you mean the one that connects to the card?  If so, I pressed down on it pretty good to insure it was fully seated.  The FX2500's second heat pipe was bent when I received it so I went ahead and returned it and will be getting a new one this Friday.  Hopefully it works. I'm at the point where I could take the laptop apart and put back together in 15 minutes...I found a used 150W on Ebay for $15 so I went ahead and purchasedit for future gaming. If the second card has the same black screen, I would venture to say that maybe it's the mother board???]]></content>

The ribbon cable I was talking about is the cable from the LCD assembly that looks like a very flimsy piece of thin plastic, that has wires in it, and attaches to the motherboard.  It's listed in the process of the LCD removal in the manual.

Does the old card work?  If so, most likely it was just the one card you got.  Go ahead and get the latest bios, just in case.

Now that is a cool idea.  The fans with the lights.  I'm pretty swamped at work for the next several weeks, or I'd look into that myself.  :)  I would start by looking at the Dell Service Manual I linked to above, and then compare the detailed pictures with the Service Manual for the XPS system.

As for the drivers, yes the drivers I linked to above are the ones I am using on my Vista install - and should fully support all 7XXX series (amongst all other nvidia cards pretty much up to about 6mo ago).  ]]></content>

There is much more on the forums, so search around for 9300 and 7900/7950.

I will remove 9300 from my post, as I did verify my 9400 works - so I could not verify an 9300 independantly.

@Frank: That's great to hear!  "Enhance performance".  Well, you can overclock the GPU (search the links I supplied above).  Me?  This is my work/primary machine, so I chose stability over overclocking.  

In addition to that, just make sure you have the correct drivers.  And 4GB will help, for how cheap they are these days.  Even if you only get 3.2GB of them every GB helps - and you can use the ram in a newer laptop down the road (most likely).]]></content>

My wife's mom just bought an E1720 and it bugged me that she now has a better system than my E1705, so I went poking around for ways to hotrod my laptop. I am totally impressed by what you have done with your machine and plan to do something similar.

What I am wondering is this: if I replace my T2400 processor with a T7200 and install 64 bit XP Pro, will it be able to see all 4gig? Do you foresee any problems with this? Also, if this is a good play, is there any reason you didn't do it?

<P>To answer your question, no. &nbsp;Changing the cpu, upgrading the bios, 64bit os, nada will enable any operating system to see more then 3.2 GB of ram. &nbsp;It's the limit of the bios (think PCI being a 32bit bus, and 32bit is limited to 2 GB space).</P>
<P>No system will really have full access to 4GB (or my next machine I am planning - 16 GB), unless there is no PCI 32bit bus. &nbsp;All PCIe or PCI64bit (i.e. servers).</P>
<P>As to your final question of why I didn't do it... Didn't do what? &nbsp;I actually did install 4 GB of ram, and utilize the limited 3.2 GB of it in Vista x86 (32bit). &nbsp;I did use 64bit for a short time, and all drivers were available from Dell. &nbsp;But some of the software I use for programming and such just had issues on x64. &nbsp;So I am back to x86 for now. &nbsp;If, that was your question. &nbsp;:)&nbsp; </P>
<P>If you question was asking why I didn't go with a faster CPU, it's because there is no real point for me cause I&nbsp;already have the T7200.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Once you have the Core2 Duo @ 2.0Ghz (no point in paying for anything faster), you have the cream-of-the-crop with 4MB of cache (2MB per core).&nbsp; Anything less in speed only has 2MB (1MB per core).&nbsp; Yes, the T7200 is worth the upgrade!&nbsp; And I made damn sure I had it when I originally ordered my laptop.</P>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi Eric,
Wow, this site gets alot of questions. I am sure I am not the only one who appreciates the time and effort you give in tech support to everyone who visits your blog.
I have two questions please:
1. I have the Core Duo T2600 in my 9400. At the time when I got it, it was the best I could get. Then when core duo 2 came out with double the L2 cache I was miffed! Can I purchase the T7200 and replace that in my lappy?

2. I have 4Gb in my lappy and I did the optimise thing with the /3gb option and I got XP 32 bit seeing the 3.25Gigs as well as some of my adobe products which needed that option to recognise more than 2Gb. But, recently when I boot up I get a message something like, "I am low or have run out of registry space and the registry will no longer be updated etc etc.." - I have over 150Gigs free in my 250Gig internal HDD! Any clues?

1) Yep, absolutely.  Don't purchase anything slower or faster than the T7200 as it would be a waste of money.  Slower has less cache; faster is just paying the huge premium for just a few hundred mhz.

2) Has nothing to do with hardware.  Something is corrupted in the registery, could have a virus (never seen Windows say, "I am low..." on ANYTHING).  

I had a policy of formatting every 6mo.  I had a drive C and a drive D.  C hovered around 36 to 50 GB of space for my OS and all software install.  Drive D had all of my project, media, desktop (editing the location of the profile folders), etc.  So I would just wipe drive C from time to time and install the OS/software.

Here's one good news about Vista: Since I moved to Vista in my laptop last year, I haven't formatted again - and don't see a need to.  Vista really is stable.  As long as you don't load down your OS with a bunch of crap.]]></content>

So I just buy a T7200 and take the old one out and the new one just falls into place? :) cOOL!

The message I get in windows only happens when I boot into the /3gb option. When I do not boot into it, I never get that message....do you still think its a virus?]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@McMood: Yes, the bios will recognize the difference.  There's nothing u have to do to the OS either.

About the error message, again, I don't think it's anything to do with hardware and is outside of the scope of this discussion (u didn't leave an email address).  But yes, you'd most likely get it with the /3GB switch than without.

Do you actually know what /3GB does?  It's more than "access to 4GB of memory", and actually it's not that at all.  32bit variables in code are limited to 2,147,483,647.  Windows 32bit (x86) uses a 32bit integer to address memory space, therefore the limit being 2 GB (long story short).

Windows has two memory address spaces: One for the applications, and one for the operating system, kernel, and yep - the registry.  By default, this gives you a 4 GB memory cap the entire Windows OS can use, with a max of 2 GB assigned to your Applications space to use and a max of 2 GB for the kernel to use.  This is why you only see 2 GB in Windows with 4GB of ram.  The OS does a 50/50 split on whatever memory you have.  So if you have 2GB installed, you'll only have 1 GB available for applications (actually, this changes with pagefiles under 4 GB, another discussion).

Having 2 GB for the kernel is well more than enough for heavy powerusers.  The kernel includes all I/O addressing, registry, drivers, system tasks, some background tasks, and more.

The /3GB switch does something special.  It changes the 50/50 split of memory to a 25/75 split: the Kernel gets 25%, the Application space gets 75%.  So in a 4GB system, that's 1 GB for the kernel and 3 GB address block for the applications (how it does this, beyond the 32bit limit, is a longer story).

With that said, no I don't think it's a virus at all: You just got too many damn things loaded on your PC.  :)  Or loaded/unloaded.  When you install and uninstall, it doesn't always clean up registry space.

Let me guess, was this an "Upgrade" of XP from a previous version?  Upgrades leave a huge amount of registry crap.

Long story short: Just format and clean out everything.  You can spend days/weeks cleaning your registry with registry cleaners (and hope it doesn't break stuff).  But only 4 hours or so formatting and installing on the applications u use.

Fyi, Vista no longer has this limitation (they got rid of the 50/50 split, double memory allocation spaces).  It's why you can install 4 GB and you are good to go, without a registry limit.]]></content>

Another concern I have is I've come accross a post about a guy having serious issues with Linux on this bad boy with 4GB installed, just Hangs Ubuntu (and any live distro he tried) I think he was on Fiesty Fawn(7.04). Have you tried any linux variants on here with the 4GB?(http://ph.ubuntuforums.com/showthread.php?t=667640)

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Bryan Lahartinger: 

If you are a serious poweruser, you might (might like in a hair) notice a difference between 533mhz and 667mhz memory by the snappy response windows seem to appear.  But that is just speed.  

Performance gains from 2 GB to 4 GB (actually only 3.25GB in the 9400) is little to null; because, it would depend upon what you are using the laptop for.  If you exceed 1 GB in application memory (editting a dozen large Photoshop files, perhaps migrating a very large database locally on the laptop, etc), then Windows XP/Vista will start to dig into your "Page File".  The pagefile is when Windows uses your HDD as virtual memory; because, it is out of physical memory (or may be reserving physical memory for something else, long story).

Actually, what I have seen a lot more of lately is games taking up far beyond 1 GB of ram!  I first noticed this with Battlefield 2 at settings of 1600x1200x32 with everything set to high.  On my 2nd monitor, I decided to look at some settings on my PC and noticed that it was using 1.2 GB of ram!  I was shocked.  Battlefield 2142 is even more!

With that said, if you have some highend 3D games then upgrading to 4 GB could "increase performance", because your system won't be using the very slow HDD as virtual memory.

A very quick comparison of memory vs. HDD:

Typical SATAII 500gb HDD = ~45 to 55 MB/s
PC2-6400 DDR-2 memory = ~6.4 GB/s throughput.  <- That's GigaBytes a second, not bits.  Serious increase of 1000x the speed of HDD when moving data.  And we are only talking about the average memory and HDD hardware.  

So yes, it is worth spending the extra money on far-more-memory-than-you-need vs. a larger HDD - from a PowerUser standpoint.  ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Bryan Lahartinger: Something else to note is Vista's built-in ReadyBoost.  I know, there are lots of articles that say this is a joke especially for low-end users.

But for powerusers that need every byte of memory for development (i.e. my migration of 5GB communityserver databases!), once I popped in a fast 8GB flash card, holy cow that sped up my system.  

Google "vista readyboost" to read more.  In very short terms: ReadyBoost allows Vista to use a flashcard for your Page File, instead of your HDD.  While not as fast as pure memory, USB2's throughput is far more than your HDD.  Therefore, increasing the speed of that pagefile use.  

I can testify it really increased the performance of my system.  That is, if you are actually using some big applications.  If not, it's just a waste.

Tip: You a flash card 2.5x the size of your physical ram for "optimum performance" per MS'  algorythms.  So with 4GB in the 9400 (3.25GB visible to the system), get an 8GB memory card.  Oh, and make sure it is rated at least "150x" speed.]]></content>

But, if I had the cash...  :)  

As far as maxing out CPU, the fastest is the 667mhz Core 2 Duo t7xxx series is about it.  The t7200 being the best price-vs-performance buy.  Anything faster is just just a waste of money for such a tiny increase.

What I don't see is anyone trying the 800mhz chips, which will be the biggest increase.  You linked to the best forum to research/ask in that regard for 800mhz support - www.notebookforums.com

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[hi Eric,

It is me again! I am about to take the plunge and get a better processor from my original core duo processor. Then I am going to attempt to do the above and the processor together! :S I already have the graphics card but was just about to buy the processor when Intel announced a cut in prices for many of its processors!

Now, I have someone who has offered me a T7200 and T7500 at the same price $160. He also has a T7400 at $230 and a T7600 at $300.

Would you suggest the T7500 is the best buy? It has a higher front bus speed but a lower multiplier than the T7600 as I found on wikipedia! I have no "real" idea on what that signifies but it is half the speed and the same price as the T7200 which you suggested?

Thanks in advance!]]></content>

<P>Great post, thanks for all the info. My E1705 has been dying lately and I can't just figure out the deal. I did an upgrade from XP to Vista and wonder if it was just from the upgrade copy. I have 2GB RAM now with 4GB on order. I had a bunch of driver issues with the NVIDIA card, I got it with the GeForce Go 7900 GS and now I'm thinking the card might be going bad. I think my laptop got to hot and either RAM is damaged or maybe more. I get a ton of Blue Screens, mostly memory parity issues. It will work fine for a bit, heat up and then I get a weird graphics bug, nothing will open and all the windows that attempt to open will be black, or a dark orange with no wording visible. I will have to ctrl alt del to shutdown or restart and have the time that will bsod or freeze up.</P>
<P>Any suggestions as to what that might be? I am thinking about the graphics card upgrade and the AS5. I'm just stuck in Iraq and the E1705 isn't but a year and a half old. I'm glad I found your post about the modding though, that made me a lot happier about my purchase.</P>

Your site is just what I was looking for. I am planning to do almost the same upgrade... T7200, 4GB, and hesitating between 3500M and 2500M. But I was hoping to get x64 XP running on the new one with the ability to fully utilize all 4GB. Now that you say there is no difference, I am not sure it is really worth switching my T2400 with T7200.
Would you say Vista x32 is the same with RAM utilization as XP64 on your setup? What would be wiser choice for OS? I am running mainly 3D/2D apps as Photoshop, Pixologic ZBrush, Autodesk Maya and rendering engines.

@SPeter:
I have seen those weird stripes on my faulty 7900GS (after a year, it just "died"). You have faulty VGA. Fortunately it was still in warranty so DELL replaced it with new one. Could you say who did you buy it from on ebay, since I am planning to buy the same there.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@MaxtorAG: Vista x86 the same as XP x64, in reguards to RAM utilization.  Not exactly, but if you are referring to if the "3 GB" limit issue in XP x86 is in Vista x86, the answer is no (kind like 4.5 GB now or more in Vista x86).  But with 4 GB of ram, yes Vista x86 won't be limited similarily to how XP x64 won't be limited.

As far as the wiser choice, it boils down to 1 thing pertaining to the applications you listed (aside from features, prettiness, etc): Ram available.  You'll give up about 512 MB by switching to Vista.  But the good news is Vista has much better memory management than XP in general, especially if you utilize Vista's ReadyBoost feature.

That corruption is definitely faulty VGA (but miracles happen). Sorry about that. And it is disturbing that you bought it from round2tech, since that is supposed to be a good seller and I was going to buy FX3500 from them. Now I am not sure whether I should. Are you sure you are not doing something wrong while installing it or some MB problem? Why did your original one die?

What about SATA Drivers? I know that while/before installing an XP in my desktop, I needed to load special SATA drivers into XP setup. Will I need special SATA drivers for XP x64 for my Inspiron, or the BIOS takes care of it. So far, I have installed only original DELL XP, so I guess there is everything in it, but when I will be switching...]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@MaxtorAG:

Bios can't take care of anything.  If you needed a special Disk Driver for XP x86 (pressing F6 during install), you will need the same drivers for XP x64.  But look for 64bit versions of the driver as most drivers are written in c++, meaning they are unmanaged assemblies (bound to one type of processor or another).  

But with that said, I don't recall installing any Disk Driver (F6) on bootup on my E1705, and it's fairly new.  I got Vista x86 and x64 loaded without any driver needs.  But I did install them once the system was up.  

Now, my gf's E1520 is another story though... Dell is putting flash ram in the new computers that holds a complete backup of the default os install, called something like Cache Drive.  It's a PITA when installing your own os (disable the bitch in bios).

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey wow what a page, ya I upgraded my e1705 from a 7900gs to a fx2500 and it's AWESOM, the performace gain is huge... COD4 on the 7900gs was not even playable at decent settings, with the fx2500 it's playable with the graphics all the way up!

My 7900gs fried from getting too hot for a year and finallt crapped out, like many many other peoples 7900gs (they made a VERY bad decision and only put one heat pipe on the 7900gs and we all have paid the price)

anyways, I'm sooo curious as to whether or not the new fx1600m and fx3600m cards will work in the e1705. The 1600m is basically a 8700m and the 3600m is a 8800m! I emailed the guy on ebay who currently has one of each available (I know 300 bucks for less performace that the fx2500 sucks but it's got directx 10) and the 3600m is $750 bucks but it blazes!

I'll let you guys know if the guy who is selling them replies and if he knows it it works or not, it's not a question as to whether it will fit it's a question as to if the BIOS will work or not. They might if we could flash them to a 8700m or 8800m prior to instal but I heard that the 1600m doesn't work with the latest 1600m bios in a e1705.

I know they are hard to find those cards now but I'm sure in time more will be available and perhaps the price will come down.

but ya, e1705/9400/M90 = best laptops ever!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Matthew: Glad you jumped on the bangwagon with the rest of us.  Yep, it really is nice with that card.

As far as the new cards working with our bios, I see no reason why not.  It's a PCI Express x16 slot.  If it fits the slot, the bios will allocate resources, and all you need is drivers for your flavor of OS.

The only issue is voltage and/or wattage available for very highend cards.  I have no idea if the E1705 can supply the power for an 3600m.  But it's worth a shot.  :)

but I got the fx2500M, and i flashed it to a 7900GTX.  I think it really made a difference.  The biggest difference I see is with Guitar Hero 3.  I can now run that 1440x900 full screen all effects on with almost no stutter.  in that game you need it to run SMOOTH.
I also have the clock settings at 600 core 1500 (750) RAM and it's been at that level for some time.
 
OH i highly recommend going to best buy and getting the Toshiba 200 GB 7200 RPM hard drive upgrade kit.  comes with an external enclosure and software to facilitate the swap and use your old hd as an external.  I think i paid around $175 for it.

I'm toying with the 4 gb upgrade now.

Don't quote me, but if I remember difference between the 7900GTX and fx2500m allows you to flash down from fx2500m to 7900gtx to unlock the bios.  But not flashing from the 7900gtx up to the fx2500m, since the instruction set is different.

Finally, I have installed my quadro fx2500 and i went a little further and got the T7600 (Just had to do it :D). I got the nvidia hacked driver from where you said and it all seems to be running fine.

Although, I have still got my old power supply at the moment....

Now, I downloaded CPUID to monitor the temperatures and my idle temperatures for both my cores are around 62C and the GPU core 54C. That seems really high....I used Arctic Silver paste.....

The problem I do get at the moment, is that I leave my laptop on for alot of the day as I use it for work. Now sometimes overnight or when I go out for lunch, I come back to find that my laptop has turned off and restarted and I have lost anything I did not save! This has only started after installing the new devices and has happened at least 5 to 6 times now in the space of a week and a half.

Any ideas on what the problem is?]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Sorry guys.  I relocated from Dallas to NYC last week.  So I've been outta pocket for a while.

@Mike : Nope, that is not the correct card.  That card you mentioned is for a desktop with a PCI-E slot.  The dual DVI and tv-out kind of gives it away.

@McMood : Those temps aren't too bad actually.  The screenshot above is actually from when it was cold (winter), and I usually keep my place cold around 69F.  Now in the summer, here in ny, it's hot.  And around 78F in the home, my cpu idles around 58C.  My GPU is about 60C at 78F ambient temps.  What you want to do is a stress test, which means to peg both CPUs (cores) to 100% each.  Then monitor the temps.  I used Prime95 to do it on my system (tip: it runs only on 1 core.  You have to run two copies and configure them to use each core).

Surround sound?  Anything with opitcal out I suppose, then your speakers will take that as the best input.  Never got into which is better myself, such as decoding at the card level (more control, but uses cpu), or decoding at the speaker-level.  Any card that gives you optical out will work.

@BigArm : I can't answer that one.  Try notebookforums.com and click on the Dell 17" area.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....
Ok this seems bad....
All of a sudden during playback of a radio over the internet the audio started playing back and forth like at the end of an old LP on a gramaphone when it gets stuck on the same track. Then the screen went blank and it hasnt turned on since. Restarting the computer and even the dell bios thing does not appear. Although it seems like it is starting fully into Windows but not 100% sure. I opened the lappy up and now when I restart it doesnt boot, the num lock light is on, the caps lock and the next lock green symbol next to it flashes together for about 20 seconds before the laptop switches off!

What to do???? I appreciate your urgent help. Thanks.]]></content>

Still under warranty?  I recommend calling them and pretending u haven't done anythign to the machine.  If they say to send it in, revert the changes back to the way you bought it (original card and all).

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[ok! It seems my graphics card went kaput and then the laptop went mad....

I put the old rubbbbbbbbish ATIx1400 128Mb graphics card back in and it works...now I doubt the ebayer is going to take back my graphics card fx2500m from me so many months down the line and plus I dont think shipping back to the states is going to be worth my while.

Anyway of getting a "new" card from Dell directly?

Plus these new cards you can get on the inspiron 1720 which are 512MB nvidia will they work on the 9400/e1705?

Thanks in advance...]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@McMood: My fx2500m has 512 MB of ram.  So does the fx3500m.  I think you are referring to the fx2600 and fx3600.  Long story short (and scroll up 5 or 6 comments, I already linked to it and told ya'll about it) is yes they do fit, but there are voltage differences (screen is dimmer).  So there are a few bugs to work out.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi Eric, like most of the people posting here I too have upgraded to a new GPU, a 7900GTX, and 4gb ram. I have installed the ram successfully, and I thought the GPU as well... I was playing NWN2 and some red almost diagonal lines appeared on the screen. Since it was the first time I was playing with the new card installed I thought it was jusy some tweeking that needed to be done to the game settings or something... and suddenly the screen went black! I know the screen is on, but there is no image. I rushed to install the ol' 1400 and everything booted up and it seems no harm was done(at least to the hard drive which I feared). I am now pondering if it was something I forgot to do while setting up the new card, or if it is just a faulty card. What do you think? please help!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Dennis (and others that have broken): Here's a question, are you using the larger 130W or 150W power supplies?  If you are using the power supply that came with your Dell laptop (the 90W one), you do not have enough power and this may contribute to the damage going on here.  Just a theory.

But to answer your question, since you replaced the card with the stock one, it seems to point to the card, yes.  Fautly install?  Really depends on how everything aligned.  It's straight forward, but does need a fragile hand.

Sorry i can't be of more help.  If you have the upgraded power supply, then it could point to any number of things.  ]]></content>

It's weird, I played with it for a day or so after installing the new card and it was working fine (or it seemed), then the next day I got the 130W brick and put it to work. No problems there. I am wondering if it has anything to do with the drivers at this point. I am gonna try to re install and un install drivers and see what happens. Help me god!!!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Doing some research in notebookforums I found people having the same problem. One guy claims it is related to the "extra" heat sink from the 7900 touching a small metal piece connecting to the power outlet (I noticed it while installing the card, but didn't think nothing of it). Claims he solved the problem bending the pipe slightly so that it would not touch the metal piece... I haven't tried it yet, but if that's the case I wanted to ask if this solution made sense.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Dennis: Actually, that makes perfect sense if that is the case.  I had to do a double-take and open my images I posted above, to make sure mine was not touching.  

I think i remember seeing how it was touching mine, and went ahead and bent it anyways.  I also bent my pipe to better align the heatsink to the fans, as the normal way it was shipped to me seem to be sitting "to low" and blocked the natual airflow from the cpu's heatsink to the gpu's heatsink.

For everyone else, we are talking about the "left" heatsink (looking from the front of the laptop/normal view or use).  It is the heatsink that I used the aluminum (sp ck) foil to cover both heatsinks in the pics above.  Dennis mentions how the copper arm may be touching the power outlet.  Mine appearently isn't touching (zoom in on the picture of me holding the screw driver, and look at the bottom left for the powercode socket).  

Mine is not touching, and does sound like a valid reason.  But if you look at the pic I mentioned, the only thing that would touch it would be cast metal.  While a conductor of electricity, yes, I can't see a lot of draw through it as it seems to be a more of a type of alloy than a conducting metal.  But, it does warrant caution and I would recommend bending that pipe to get it away.

Note though before bending: do not bend while the card is installed!  I can see the socket easily breaking (or the mobo it is connected to).  I recommend removing the card and doing several test-fittings while bending.  Remove, bend, install and test alignment.  Repeat until cleared.

Good find Dennis!]]></content>

I've read this article probably at least once every two weeks since I found it back in Febuary, just waiting for the time when I would be able to do these upgrades, and hopefully put the kabosh on my NMI Parity Errors while playing WoW.

Unfortunately, It did not all go well, as I've got nasty red lines on my desktop, and spikes in the 3D renders of WoW. I got my drivers from NotebookForums, so I'm pretty sure I got a bad card. I've contacted my seller on Ebay to hopefully get an exchange.

Just really wanted to say thanks for this well written article. =D ]]></content>

See my pictures above, as I removed the heatsink - but not the actual CPU.  But you can see the CPU is removable.

Check the link I posted above about the Dell Service Manual for CPU replacement.  http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/manuals?c=us&cs=19&l=en&s=dhs&redirect=1

so i got some questions in mind: how did you know that the card you bought is compatible with your laptop? was it built for e1705/9400 or does dell's video card share the same structure? does it mean that video cards intended for XPS lineup can fit to Inspirons? 

i've read some about the M90 designer card and MXM blah blah and I can't relate with all the technical stuff, can you shed me some light on this one. thanks!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@frederic: As mentioned in the original post, the card comes in the Dell XPS series - not the 9400/e1705.  You can see the pictures of where I had to modify (i.e. cut the plastic pieces off) to get the left heatsink to fit.  Otherwise, the entire card is a drop-in fit.

Any card for the XPS 1710 series sould fit our laptops, yes.  But remember, there's a whole new breed out there.  The 1720 and 1730s, which most likely won't fit.  

To find the card I have, search eBay for "nVidia FX2500m".  Or if you want the better card, search for "FX3500m".  That's it.

As far as more technical questions, what "may" and may not fit from newer laptops, you want to visit these forums as they have the most info out of anything: http://notebookforums.com.  I even provide direct links for the FAQs of the 1705 above in the original post.

Good luck!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Melkor: Oh man, that existing drive you have is horrible in performance.  Around 15 MB/s.  Going from that 4200rpm, to the Hitachi 7200rpm (or any drive) will be a major improvement in performance!  We're talking 60 to 70 MB/s (4x)!  

But remember, this will greatly cut your battery life as the HDD is one of most power-hungry devices in a laptop (unless u are gaming, then a highend GPU like we installed above can almost match the draw of the HDD).

If you are liking your battery life, cut it almost in 1/2 - that's about what you'll get.  Check to see if you have the 9 cell battery - if you only have the 6 cell, upgrade (but it will be costly, go aftermarket).]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Just installed the 4GB RAM. As well as the BIOS even Vista is telling me I've got 4GB installed. Nevertheless available is less than that as a certain amount is used for system issues (meaning the graphics-device I guess). But still Vista shows 4GB installed (and not 3.25 as reported above)... But the score remains 4.5 - I hoped for a raise in that. Well, didn't work (of course - why should it get pushed up? 667 MHz remains 667 MHz...). But thanks for encouraging me to buy the RAM even against the manual telling me only 2GB are supported. I recognised the increase in speed instantly without any benchmarks just by navigating through the menus and using applications. Outstanding (compared to before).

Next for the hard drive. Has anyone of you a good idea for a HDD but the Hitachi 7K200 TravelStar? Maybe something nearly equal as fast but less consumpting my power? Or is it the best way to upgrade the system in speed? Which drives do you all use?]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Melkor: Which bios did you install?  I'm curious now of how you are seeing the full 4 GB in an e1705 machine (and yes, it would be the bios).

As far as HDD, it's the trade-off you always have to battle: Speed using more power, or less speed to save the power. THere is no magic wand...

Except, if you fork out for an SSD drive.  Much less power usage, with the best speed.  If you can wait until next summer, the prices will be about 1.5 times that of standard HDDs.  By 2010, they should be about 1.2.  But, they are costly now.

If you want to meet 1/2 way, look for some 5400rpm drives that are larger than 200 MB from just about any manufacturer.  You'll get the newer platters that use less power, with 16MB buffer or larger (32MB perhaps?).  Will be a vast improvement of what you got now, but not as fast as the 7200rpm drives.]]></content>

$260 for a 64 GB drive.  I just read a comparison, and the current highend 10,000rpm desktop drives barely beat out the OCZ Core Series there in that list - meaning it's fast!  The problem is the drive uses a standard SATA connector, unlike our laptop hdds.  Why must we pay double the cost for just a different interface?

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@ This Beautiful Thread

I've read everything on your mod and i'm very excited! I've had issues springing up with my Dell e1705 regarding Hardware Failure, memory parity error.

After researching this error i've come to the conclusion that there's 2 possibilities.

1) My Geforce 7900 GS is inheirently bad/causing massive overheating problems.
2) My power is leaking and affecting parts of the system. 

Apparently someone used a multi volt checker on the screws under the laptop and found voltage leaking out. I havent tested mine yet but I have taken mine apart to change out my keyboard.

The question I suppose I have now is about your foil usage regarding heat conduction with Artic Silver and how exactly you did it. I see the picture but it's a bit far away and you say it's thin. What brand/ type of foil are you using? How did you tape it up? I'm always nervous when I begin to modify any system, but I can't live with this error and perhaps this upgrade with the added Artic Silver and new GFX card will resolve my issues.

/Best

Curtis]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Curtis: Thanks for the compliment.  :)  Sorry to hear of your hardware issues.  Things like that are always hard to find.  "Power leaking"?  Even the human body has a slight negative charge.  Just haven't heard of that one before.

To your question: I just used any house-hold standard foil.  It really is too think to really transfer any real amount of heat, but it's there in case.  The main reason I used it was to better vent the air exiting the fan directly into the heatsink fins.  There is a very large gap between the two heatsinks (cpu and gpu), and i did not want that air wasted.  I elected to do it with foil for that little bit of extra chance of dissipating the heat from the hottest to the coolest.

As far as what I used to attach it, you can see the scotch tape in the picture.  Just ran it over the edges.  The AS5 keeps it a little sticky and in place as well.

Hope that helps!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Herm, I get the concept (which I think was genius), but it's the practical applications i'm confused about. You made "shrouds" of foil. I'm wondering if you wrapped the end of the heat dispersing copper conducter, or, you just put one piect across the top of both of them (with one side coated with some AS5).

Looking at the picture I really can only see all the scotch tape, it's hard to imagine what it looks like under there. =)

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Curtis: Interesting issue about the grounded prong...  Both my 90w and 150w adapters have the grounded prong, so I do not think I am at risk?  I remember the 65w travel adapter I had at Telligent and it was only two-prong (another 9400 I had there, and a few died).  That would explained why they died.

As for the application of the foil, I have a piece on top with as5 applied where it touches the copper pipes.  I also put a thin strip on the side, because of the big gap there as well.  None is required under the heatsinks as both omy heatsinks were almost touching the bottom of the case.  I actually bent my GPU copper pipe to get the heatsink to sit all the way down on the plastic case - therefore sealing the "under" area.  I guess I coul dhave install a small piece of felt under the heatsinks to better control any millimeter air-gap at the bottm - but it's pretty flush so I didn't see a need.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Just a word back to the hard drive I wrote about above:

I meanwhile bought a Samsung Spinpoint M5S 250GB 12ms/8MP/5400 rpm.

Althought the mentioned Hitachhi Travelstar 7K200 200GB 10ms/16MB/7200rpm has way better data the power consumption of the Samsung is way fewer. The difference to my former HDD you can "feel" and see every moment and the 9cell akku still endures 1 hour 45 mins (with standard balanced energy mode). Additionally the Spinpoint is really very silent, I don't hear anything even when using the drive intensively (e.g. defrag, virus scan and so on). Finally I read quite a handful of feedbacks within which people first wrote how outstanding the Travelstar is and what a huge performance upgrade it provides - but after few weeks or months there is an additional comment that the Hitachi drive simply and without any annoucment refused to work. It simply crashed an needed to be replaced. First I thought, ok, such things happen occasionally. But than those reports got more and more.

Well, now with the Spinpoint (at least at the moment) everything is fine, Windows Vista gives me 5.3 points for it an I no longer have the feeling that the hard drive slows down the entire system. And the Spinpoint costed 2/3 of the Travelstar, no heat problems at all, no vibrations or whatever. I really can recommend it! Those who need high end performance should maybe choose the Hitachi (or buy a SSD) but those who just seek for an upgrade and don't want to loose mobility and therefore gain loudness and vibrations are best served with it.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[WOW! I've just read this entire thread and am superbly impressed with it all. I'm a VERY big laptop noobie in my opinion, only changing the keyboard once. I've had an M1710 for about 2 years now, and recently flashed my 7950 go gtx to unlock it. So I've been experimenting with ocing it, getting about 15% boosts in preformance, but find that I really should get the heatsinks cleaned and probably use AS5 to get my idle temps down.
I was curious if you guys could offer me any advice (plus being that the E1705 is very similar to it) on what needs to be removed etc. I'm not freaked out about the LCD removal or keyboard, but mostly the general top of the laptop, how to reconnect those antennae leads to the wifi card once I get them off, and when I get to the gpu and cpu how I should be putting AS5 on once I get down there.

Also my HDD has been getting frequent bad sectors and I think it's because it idles (the Hard disk) at 42C. Any advice?
Thanks a shamillion!!

@Matchbox from Canada: Those HDD temps aren't bad.  If you are getting bad sectors, it's time for a new HDD.  You can format, which will skip those bad sectors (sometimes); but, the drive is degrading.  Take a look at Melkor's HDD he just bought a few comments above yours.

As for what needs to be removed (upper part), it's no biggie.  It's why I took the photos above.  Also, the Dell repair manual I linked to in the original post has very detailed instructions.  I just made a post about the extra bits that the manual doesn't go too much into detail for.

As far as opening up the laptop, it does not require previous electrics experience.  But instead, a steady-as-she-goes approach to one little thing at a time, very carefully, knowing that things can easily snap and break - except the Keyboard cover above in the forth pic.  That was scary - prying and pulling on that piece of plastic that felt like it was going to break.  But, I wanted to blog about it because it did not.  You just have to be a little forceful.  

The only other area of concern is the ribbon cables (tightly packed thin film-like cables) that connect the keyboard/trackpad and the LCD to your motherboard.  

Besides those concerns, anyone that has held a screw driver can handle all repairs to the laptop.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Upgraded to a 7900GTX and a faster processor.  The 7900 crapped out after a month and the guy who sold it to me on eBay offered to replace it with an Quadro 1600m (he had no more 7900s).  I checked out the specs and it looks good.  I know it's not a gaming card, but since I was 15 days past his return period, I figure I'm lucky to get anything.  I'll let you know once it's installed how it performs compared to the 7900GTX.  

Also, I'm curious about the RAM issue.  I added another GB about a year ago (total 2GB) and I see that someone on here upgraded to 4GB.  Can someone who is successfully using 4GB post the E1705 BIOS revision you are using please?  Thanks.]]></content>

I've never had a 2600m.  I had a 7900GTX, which died, so I'm just hoping that the 1600m that is replacing it is at least as good as the 7900GTX.  We'll see when I install it tomorrow.  ]]></content>

My 7900GTX was great at high detail, but the 1600m is a little choppy and not really playable at high detail.  Even at medium detail it's still not as smooth as the 7900GTX.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey Eric, thanks for the excellent guide.  My E1705's video card recently died, and I am thinking of using it as an opportunity to upgrade.  Of course, all you can find out there now is refurbs, which makes me a bit nervous.  At any rate, I have read elsewhere that you must have the 9 cell battery for the upgrade to the fx2500 to work.  Is that true?  I rarely use my 1705 on battery power, so the 6 cell works fine for me.  Can I do this upgrade without changing batteries?]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Tony: Actually, I have the 7900GTX core in my FX 2600m Quatro card (see my original post waaaay above).  Yeah, 512 MB on the card doesn't do well for Bioshock.  But it's far better than the ATI card, and one-ups the 1600m cards.

@Rich: Refurbs are fine, as it is what I got.  But be warned that several of them have died very quickly, or were INOP when tey arrived.  So, make sure you can return the card to the vendor, and test it immediately when your card arrives.  So you are not stuck with a time limit to return it.

As for needing a 9 cell battery; nope, it is not needed.  As a matter of fact, I usually use my 6-cell around the house as it is much lighter (and I rather have the 6-cell die out from over-use, as most lappy batteries do).  The 9-cell is needed if you want to do any type of animation or graphics, as the extra wattage will be needed.  I.e., do not play any games on the 6-cell.  Besides, it would only last 5 to 10m too.]]></content>

Im fairly happy with the performance of the card as i can run crysis on medium with no lag. i wondered if upgrading the ram really makes much difference in high quality games like crysis. I currently have 2gb of ram and can find the 4gb sets for as little as $70 i have the money but is it really worth it??? Also would overclocking be advised???]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Daabaa: Actually, going from the ATI x1400 to a 7900 is a big improvement in 3D performance.  Yes, it was worth it (depending on what you paid for the card).

As for 4gb vs 2gb, I know my Battlefield 2 and 2142 games used over 1.5 GB of ram, with all graphics turned up at high resolution.  My Vista idles around 700 to 800 GB in use, so that would put me over the 2GB limit.  For me, it was worth it.  

If you are running XP, sitting around 128 to 200 MB in use - it may not be. 

If you plan on upgrading to Vista or running Windows 7, I'd recommend it.  My next laptop will have 8 GB, just to let you know what I am planning on (virtual machines).]]></content>

While it is optimum to run an 800mhz FSB on the CPU, with 800mhz memory (1:1 ratio), I do not think the 1705 series will do 800mhz. 

I could be completely wrong, and it may actually do that!  If so, I will be upgrading myself.  :)

@Everyone: Over the last 6 months, I relocated to NYC and have been so overwhelmed that I have not even started a game what-so-ever.  Recently, my almost-2yrs old install of Vista x86 was going good - but not as good as my Vista x64 I had on my work laptop.  I've really enjoyed Vista x64's performance and even the program restrictions, preventing me from "bloating" my machine.

So this week, I formatted and went to Vista x64 on this particular laptop.  I have time to settle back into the ways-of-things, so for the first time I installed CoD4's Demo (yeah, I'm late to the game).  Whoa...  It plays VERY nice!  I upped the graphics to 1920x1200, but didn't really touch on any other details.  It is still very smooth.  Not sure on the framerate, but it is at least 30fps-smooth at 1920x1200.

This card/laptop looks like it will live on for a good while longer, as I was debating on building another desktop.  Guess I'll hold off on that until next year for a 2009 tax deduction.  :)

i purchased a dell xps1710 a year ago and guess wat one fine day while playing a movie it gave a driver error and then after that graphics went completely bad. Tried to check online some other people faced the same problem and concluded that might have to buy a new graphics card. Now the thing is if i buy the current graphics card which is there in the laptop ie nvidia GEforce Go 7950 gtc with 512mb i might have shell out almost $500 so i thought if i could actually put a lower end graphics card like ATI readeon mobility x1400. It would be cheaper. What do you reckon is it a good idea. Besides that do you know where can i buy it from. Coz i tried to find the same on the ati's website but am unable to find the price and also a link that might lead me to the puchase. Or i will have to buy it from dell itself. 

Btw i only use it for watching the movies. ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Adam, yeah man, unfortunately it won't take anything other than a socket M 667 FSB cpu. The last one made by intel was the T7600
HOWEVER, if you find a modded bios, you can force flash so you're bios will allow overclocking, then buy a T7600G with an unlocked multiplier. I just did that recently.
@Eric and everyone. 
Thanks so much for your original encouragement, I've opened up a total of 8 laptops in my life :P and this was by far the EASIEST one ever (I was expecting lots of difficulties, none at all.) So easy, I'm totally at ease with it. I was able to change out the fans with faster ones, changed the paste, and installed a new super small 5Volt fan via USB inside the laptop for better cooling. I even made my own laptop cooler (the ones to buy all don't blow enough air) to blow air through the vent for ram (which I took off and installed another heatsink)

I'm stuck with what to do about this thermal pad for my northbridge (it actually seems to be a bottleneck) though, and I couldn't get into my gcard cause it needs a torx bit. I'll see about dealing with both those things when my website is up and when I have more time (being a student :P, the website is going to be about mostly turning m1710's into overclocking machines, unheard of for laptops :P. )

...The mobo can support only the dx9 cards btw guys, I tried a dx10, but even though it boots it works like crap (cause unlike a 'regular' pc bios, this one will only detect any other vcard other than ones with a dell somewhere in their bios as some random vga card.) I tried, it didn't work...frown. Plus it messes with the LCD brightness big time (probably a bios issue)
ANYWAYS!
My temperatures were pretty high, and now with overclocking even the temps are freaking lower.
See here if you'd like my super high clocks & low temps with the M1710. 

http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5696/highestocsuw3.png


The motherboard and everything is IDENTICAL to the Inspiron, except for the BIOS, I wouldn't see why a forced flash wouldn't work for people to get T7600G cpus and overclock for better preformance. Hell you might even be able to get the lights in it :P Not the touchpad one though more than likely.
If anyone's interested in 'those' cpus, I can help you find them, even though they are rare, it's easier to find overseas (and a lot cheaper then getting them from Dell, 300 bucks as opposed to 1600 :O )What might help you is the sSpec of the cpus. Which is.....SL9U5. Intel won't have it on their website, but it exists, hell I think there might be one on ebay even (which is frankly very rare since I looked for this thing for almost a year straight and used a lot of coffee up doin it.)

So thank you Eric for the earlier encouragements! :)

My question to you guys...what should I use to replace the purple northbridge (co-processor) thermal pad? A better one? AS5? (Which I have there now...but seems to still be too hot), put in another little fan? or adding metal to the heatsink to make up for space (like folded aluminum foil with AS5 on everyfold). Could a different BIOS possibly allow better fan control for it?
BTW!! For anyone wishing to force flash, or with m1710's already. If you overclock, your fans will AUTOMATICALLY go to maximum, 4600RPM, which is great, because using RM Clock you can make it go slower and get even better stock speed cooling. Plus it boots in about 20 seconds.

Thanks again guys! Hope to hear input! ;)]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Matchbox:  Excellent post (and man, I need to revamp my site - these blog comments look ugly).

Yes, please do setup that website!  While I most likely won't be upgrading the cpu or overclocking, I am sure there are plenty out there that want to.

To answer your question about the Northbridge, yeah I want something to fill that gap.  If you did not fill the gap between the chip and the heatsink, and simply put a glob of AS5 on it, that is not efficent.  AS5 works best with a film of 0.05" spread (yes, extremely thin).  Any more allows for micro air pockets that do not transfer heat.  As for taking up the space between the NB and the heatsink, I would advise against that and look into bending the heat pipe to force the heatsink directly onto the chip, allowing for a thin film of AS5.  Can't get any better than that (except a custom heatsink and fan, if you are willing).

In terms of rather its worth the effort (hacking the bios, overclocking the cpu, etc), it is well known in the overclocking world that Intel, and especially the Core series, all respond to higher FSB speeds than clock speeds.  Your screenshots show you operating at a 667Mhz FSB (stock speed), but a 19x multiplier (nice!) to get the 3.1Ghz speed.  But with the FSB at 667, that's still a bottleneck for performance.

I saw this personally with my own rig:  I was running a Pentium D @ 4.6Ghz at 1066Mhz FSB with ram 1:1.  When I switched to 4.1Ghz but the FSB at 1250Mhz, with ram at 1250Mhz, I got much higher FPS in games, about 15% improvement in cpu tests, and so on.  

I'd say you have taken a great laptop to the extreme!  But until I build another desktop machine, I aint touching my one-and-only personal machine I have - the 1705.  :)

Make that website!]]></content>

The FX1600m works!! Are you totally sure? The motherboard would detect it but I would think that the custom dell bios wouldn't allow very good control over it (or much preformance at that).

MAYBE. The Bioses of the two are NOT the same. However, the motherboards themselves are completely identical in every way that I've seen (Hell the plugs for extra LED lights are even in the 1705 mobo, proving it's the exact match for the m1710.)]]></content>

It wasn't posting before cause it's SOOO huge :P.

@ Erik
I can do that max overclock, but only in short bursts of a minute. Otherwise the thing just straight up dies while on both cores. The highest stable clock I can get is 3ghz really. However, the FSB is a limiting factor, and since dell has kindly locked me out of that option, and I have tried software based ocing to no avail...it seems I'm out of options. I can take a look inside again to see if there's a readable pll module in there to read and hopefully fsbsoft or cpucool have been updated enough to allow me to adjust them :D. The motherboard says FOXCONN everywhere though, so at least we have a grim idea about it's true maker. Along with on the heat sink for the cpu as well.

I have already got the small fan in there blowing below the video card and pulling air from the space in the battery bay. Along with taking that thermal pad and using thermal paste to put the northbridge heat sink in contact with the heatpipe for the video card. It seems to have helped a fair bit, but can't wait to get some copper shims in there instead, huge improvement over what I have I'm sure :P.

Yes they did get it working I was on those forums, it's unfortunate though cause apparently it still really hasn't 'worked' persay. It can display stuff, but brightness control isn't working well and it's still shown as an unknown video card in windows. Plus according to the benchmarks, unless you REALLY want DX10, it's kind of pointless cause it preforms slightly worse than a stock 7950 go gtx. It's kind of like getting an FX3500M, it's the same preformance as a go 7950, it just has the CAD certification crap.
Now, if I could get an FX 3600M working in my lappy, with a bigger power brick too...probably in the 180 200 range, i'd be effing good to go. However, don't know if there's a type that'll fit, and even if it did, the fans might not be good enough, plus hell the bios might still be too limited to allow full control just like the quadro fx1600m senario. If you go on notebookforums and talk to zzpulp, he's very very, very experienced with mobile video cards, so he'd be the man to talk to about it.

Well, the motherboard is identical (the plugs for some models aren't actually there apparently, but the places to solder them on are). If you could get the right diagonostics on there :P and if you could force flash a m1710 bios onto your lappy, it would MAYBE work. I'm saying that because they look identical, but it would be difficult to say without seeing how they make it for absolute sure, but if I were a betting man, and I am, I'd say to save money they are the exact same board.

The problem is of course, an E1705 bios won't open up any multipliers for you, and without bios support, even using software to overclock the multiplier won't work. The M1710 bios at A03 revision or higher can do it. I would love to know how to force flash a motherboard, I've looked for some third party stuff but haven't found very much :( . Plus, dell (and most companies) have their bioses on the web bundled with the flasher itself. If there was a switch you could use in the flasher to tell it in dos to force a flash even if there's a mismatch, it might be doable. Otherwise, I don't know how you're gonna peel the bios out of the exe, and then get some other flasher program to do the dirty deed. Of course, this is presuming it works at all. If it didn't, you'd be left with a piece of worthless motherboard, unless you unsoldered the cmos chip and soldered a new one on :P (VERY unlikely). However, I'm fairly confident it would work if it were forced. They look exactly the same to me, the m1710 and e1705 mobos. I may be flashing my motherboard soon (I'm not scared, I still have my warranty :P ), so I can see if there's an option to force a flash or not. 

The only other way, and this is true of an unlocked multiplier t7600, to overclock is to adjust the front side bus frequency. I myself, have tried, relentlessly until I finally just bought an unlocked cpu. I'll eventually be going back into my lappy, so I'll see if maybe it's possible nowadays (6 months later, if they updated some plls, it's mostly for desktops though :(  
The programs you can try are CPUcool and softFSB or which I know. You need to know the pll module and the motherboard maker......unfortunately all I know right now is that possibly FOXCONN makes the motherboard. It won't hurt your computer if you try looking for settings and seeing if the laptop can be read at different frequencies. If you find one that reads, 166mhz, you're probably in luck, otherwise your not. If you try adjusting the fsb blindly, it most likely will cause a lock up and a forced reboot. Worst case scenario, you're computer will die, or die after a couple days because something exceeded it's limit and just hangs in there for that long :P . (Woe to my video memory. :P )

Otherwise, there's a billion and two people looking for those T7600Gs or life. They are ususally found overseas (for me at least, got mine from the uk from a site called ultratecdirect I believe...can't remember). Since most people don't know that, nor the proper way of finding them (Type the sSpec Intel Cpu ID in google "SL9U5" is the T7600G unlocked ;)   ), 


http://www.cpu-world.com/sspec/SL/SL9U5.html

that is 'most' people, I suggest you sell it on ebay in the worst scenario. I honestly think you would make upwards of 400-600 us dollars from it, if not more, so if you bought it for 405 Canadian like me :P You'd actually make money. That is, if you give up on force flashing, research it a little, and know the risks, a worthless motherboard. I'd start by downloading the A03 bios .exe from dell and looking for stuff to take it apart.
Also so you know, getting a gpu upgrade is much better for gaming. My 'overclock' only gets me an additional 6-8 fps before it begins throttling on me (not as much as it did at first however) however at stock 2.33, with my core at 680mhz, I get some rediculous increases, upwards of 25-30 (especially battlefield 2, demo :P I play that shit all the time.) Either that or you can overclock you gpu, but again this involves flashing which I 'can' help you with.....but it IS a little bit tricky, and can have the same effect of rendering your laptop as a useless piece of &%$#%$^&er. (try to imagine <-- :P) But preformance will benefit a shatload more than a gpu upgrade. Unless your cpu is throttling below 2 ghz, it's the gpu that's the bottleneck.

@ Anyone who wants an FYI.

And to everyone on that note, I believe that in speedfan when you are running temps, that the DIMM sensor it finds is NOT your memory, but in fact is the memory on the video card. It increases at the same rate as the gpu core pretty much exactly when I watched the graphs, and seems to be responsible for a lot of the throttling of the cpu, Temp4 sensor seems to be my actual DDR2 ram. Northbridge I am still unsure...if it's even there at all. Hopefully it's not DIMM after all :P. I'll find out eventually when I bring this thing to school.
With the mods I've done, it does not throttle in games below 2.5 - 2.66 range, before it was throttling even at stock 2.33ghz to my horror. It's still a preformance nightmare though. It will sometimes throttle on me down to 266mhz, however I found that by setting a throttle preset in RM Clock, I can actually get it to stay at about 1.6Ghz without throttling no matter what (till the point it'll freeze and explode if I wanted, it won't stop till the TM1 sensor is tripped, so I have to be careful at that setting). Also, a benefit of the M1710 bios is that when you overclock to 3.16ghz, the fans will go to full, and then you can use RM Clock to reduce the clock speed, so you have a very cool system with all clock speeds available to you. 'Tis How I got my rediculous 27C idle for my cpu (Running at 700Mhz, lowest voltages 0.9475Volts, and a 20C room :P)

Hopefully that helps with you guys.

@SPeter,

Yes they did get it working I was on those forums, it's unfortunate though cause apparently it still really hasn't 'worked' persay. It can display stuff, but brightness control isn't working well and it's still shown as an unknown video card in windows. Plus according to the benchmarks, unless you REALLY want DX10, it's kind of pointless cause it preforms slightly worse than a stock 7950 go gtx. It's kind of like getting an FX3500M, it's the same preformance as a go 7950, it just has the CAD certification crap.

/quote

I stand corrected. I was looking in the 3500M thread out of obsession for getting that card working in my laptop. Apparently the FX1600M is buggy, but it DOES work and the bios does semi support it enough to play games and have it be very useable. My bad bud :). It was the 3500M that is having brightness issues and isn't working correctly...to my dismay...meaning the 7950 gtx or FX 3500M /1600M are the best we can do for our little Xpses and their inspiron cousins...until someone hacks the m1710 bios successfully like one man did with the Nvidia 7 go series bioses]]></content>

  Amazing website, the best I've seen so far! I love all the detailed information and am seriously considering upgrading to the 3600fx as opposed to the 7950gtx as I orignally wanted. I am going to follow all the steps and have already taken my laptop apart after my 7800 go crapped out. Dell replaced it with a another faulty one for $200, so I had it replaced a third time free of charge. I just wanted to know what the BEST of the BEST video cards are out there for the Inspiron E1705. I know its prob the 3600fx, but I want to make sure I'm future proofing my lappy as long as I'm going to operate on it. Also, do you think its worth upgrading my T2300 processors to T7600? I'm interested in doing so if the performance is worth it.  I truly thank God for people like you who share their knowledge...

Thanks for the help on the processor overclocking. I have yet to get the processor, as I just bought it on ebay. The post on ebay said it was an engineering sample of the original T7600 with the multiplier unlocked, I'll take a closer look as soon as i get it. I'm running on the T7200 2.00Ghz processor right now, so if i can sell the new one and just get a normal 2.33ghz T7600 AND save some money, that may be the way to go. I just put in a 7950 GTX card and was thinking about overclocking it, but don't know where to start, I used to overclock my old ATI x1400 with ATI Tool, but that is all I know. Unfortunately this is my main computer, so I'd like to be careful about how I go about these major overhauls... Thanks for the help.]]></content>

Just to let you know that I have just successfully modded my Ins 9400/E1705 with a FX2500m as per your guide.  Thanks a million for all the useful hints etc.  Boy! what a difference a simple graphics card can make....I bought my E1705 with a GO 7900 GS (215MB) and I thought it was OK!  The FX2500M mod is worth it.  Have installed 4GB and am running XP pro SP3.  Drivers from www.laptopvideo2go.com - great value those guys.  Driver worked perfectly first time - NO artefacts etc etc - NO glitches.  Used Artic Silver 5 and polished my CPU as per your instructions and also filled gaps and did the al foil trick etc.....just perrrrrrfect!  CPU runs at 32 C to 34 C and GPU at 54 C.  Before it was well above these temps - 70-80 C etc etc.  Have ordered the PA-15.  A NEW laptop!  What can i say, but MANY MANY THANKS.]]></content>

Thank you for the guide to replace the graphic card.

The Go 7900 gs card in my Dell was overheated after 2 years.  I just ordered a fx3500 on Ebay.  After installing the new card and turning it on, only black / blank screen came up (not even the blue DELL logo).  I could tell that the lcd was on, and the hdd was reading.

I swapped back with the old card, and it displayed the post screen, with DELL logo, ok.

I checked previous posts, I'm sure the lcd cabe connecting the motherboard is securely attached.

I am using the 90W power adaptor that came with the laptop.  Would that be the reason?  Or do I need to install new firmware for fx3500 before using it?

Any help is appreciated, Thanks a lot!

Do you know how to burn a .iso file image to a cd? If you do, then I've made something that should streamline the video flash process for you.
And if it 'does' work when I post the image, show us your best overclocks eh? :P

And two quick other things...

According to your cpuz, your cpu is running at max voltage. I run at 2.83Ghz on a T7600G at that voltage. If you download rightmark cpu clock utility, and set the voltage down to 0.975V in that program (it will show 1.08V in cpu-z) your temperature will go down by about 10 degrees or so, je te kid not, and it will still run great, if it doesn't, turn the voltage up by a single notch. (.013V). Plus you save power!:)

Also, I know my drivers are a LOT older, but for yours at 175.32...., I'm uncertain if they will allow overclocking. If they don't right now, then it's possible that they won't even with the unlocked bios (driver locked overclocking, I believe anything above drivers 169.04 are useless for overclocking now for mobiles).
If the unlock doesn't work, try downgrading to that driver or a version before and see if it works. That is once I get the iso up on my site. The uni's having issues. And I have to get my drivers up :P.

I reinstalled XP, which during that process I encountered issues with random files not being able to be copied over per the XP Setup process.  I have tried multiple XP install discs, including one shipped with lappy, same issue.  

I have since desided to unseat and reseat the RAM in hopes that would be the delinquent in the system.  I would have never been able to do any of this before reading this post, so thanks again for everyone who has contributed here!

I will probably upgrade GPU/CPU/RAM together, currently running:

GeForce 7800Go
Processor,80539,YONAH,T2300 1.66
512MB 533MhZ RAM 

Thanks again!

I'd just spend $40 on 4 GB of ram, and the WD HDD mentioned above in the comments for super-quiet and speed (anything is better than the HDDs that come with the systems). 

A faster CPU will net you speed under intense apps; but, is it just me or did the T7x00 processors greatly increase in price lately?  I see my T7200 at almost $400.  That doesn't sound right (pricewatch).  Must be a shortage.  

None-the-less, don't spend more than $200 on a CPU.]]></content>

I've made it very simple for you. Hopefully it works.

I just finished making the boot disk image for my site for others in time, the cd includes a bunch of vbioses that are backups and unlocked ones.
Just go to my website and click in the News pop-up box, it'll be there literally spelt out for you.

http://web.unbc.ca/~prior/m1715/index.html

I don't have time to keep doing the site until reading week, but I should let you know what to do.

Firstly, Burn the .iso image to a cd using any program you want that can do it. 

In the hopes that it works, go reboot and boot from it. There's a backup of your bios on the cd, but just incase you want to be that much extra safer, you can save your bios using a program called nvibitor.exe which you can google up. Then just take what you see on the cd directory and copy it to another folder with that bios and burn a new cd, make sure it's bootable. I might be including the tools I used on my next boot disk sometime.

Make sure you're on AC Power.

Now boot the disk, when you're greeted with a menu, select option 2 (emm386 max memory, you'll need the memory at max otherwise the flash will most definately hang). 

Now type dir/w at the command prompt and see what you have. Look for a file named 795GTXUN.rom, that's the unlocked bios.
Two other bioses to be aware of is bu.rom which is the .12 bios locked and the 795GTXNN.rom which is the .06 bios locked. Those are backups in case the flash goes horribly wrong.

type nvflash 795gtxun.rom
Make sure it detects your video card, and that the versions of things are the same.
Make sure nvflash says flashing is ok,
press y for confirmation,
pray.
Make sure you see computer lights flashing around.

When it's done it should reboot on it's own.

IF anything here goes wrong, as in the flash doesn't work or it hangs (stops going for more than 20 minutes) then you'll have to either 1) Have a spare card you can use to boot to and then force flash your old card, 2) blind force flash your old card bios back on, 3) buy a new card.

This process can yield lots of gains, but the risk that your card will be killed is also great, so take every procaution.

I've included the Dell A03 bios on here as well, in case you wanted to try flashing your inspiron to be able to use the t7600g. It probably won't even let you flash, and it's a much bigger risk since both boards look identical but you can never be 100% sure unless you watch it being made.

Hope this helps, if something goes wrong, post on here and I'll try to walk you through what you can do to save your card, but this is at your own risk.

Also you should be able to get about 500 bucks for the t7600g on ebay, it's a hot product on there usually, you should set a reserve around thatish.

There's bioses on there for the 7800 and 7900 go series too and their backups. Justfyi the bioses weren't made by me, only 795gtxun.rom was tweaked a little by me, I'm running on it now it should work perfectly. There are those two revisions though so make sure everything matches before flashing.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Well if nvflash shows that everything looks the same it shouldn't be a problem. It's much riskier for force flashing a different card (ie. trying to make a quadro into a geforce) but not AS much if nvflash says go ahead. 

Just be sure you're on ac power, have selected max memory (so it doesn't run out of memory midflash) which is an option during bootup, and that you have a warranty in effect :P if you have little morals. 

The reason I'm so unkeen about it is because it can ruin your card doing it, I've flashed about 6 times thus far in life, and my first ever attempt caused me to turn my laptop into a piece of shat that couldn't power on. I learned my lesson there (that was NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER flash while in your native os, only from something else that's  like bootable, too much can go wrong in something like winxp doing that:P, this is it's own bootable media though)

But I did flash my video card this way, and it has been working great and I can overclock. Pretty well too.]]></content>

Once I get copper from somewhere or possibly fairly good preformance heatpads I'm going to attempt to lap the gpu, cpu and northbridge heatsinks.

Just wanted to ask, there's these little raised bits of metal in the way where I'm sure heat pads are designed to go. Should I "try" to sand them away? How'd you end up sanding it properly? Also I did get the graphics card apart (it wasn't too painful actually) And was curious about that one too (same outlining raised metal crap in the way of lapping:P)

So far I have gotten my temps fairly low but I'm aiming for 2 degrees C above ambient at idle still :P. quite far from my 10 degrees right now. C not F.]]></content>

As I recall, force flashing you type

nvflash.exe (unlockedbioshere).rom -4 -5 -6 

A regular flash is 

nvflash.exe (unlockedbioshere).rom

Also try typing nvflash.exe --version

That will tell you if it even sees your card.

But the boot disk itself boots? (I'll be quite content if it does) also make SURE you selected option 2 at the boot prompt]]></content>

I've got a couple questions. I have posted a pic of th gpu copper heatsink I have and you can see the rectangle bits I'm talking about which seem to be an indication of where to put a phase pad for techs.

http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/1525/img1002kj6.jpg

you can also see it's scratched to hell.
My question for lapping is, did you just remove them? Exactly how did you do it with these heatsinks so that it was flat (since they aren't exactly a regular cpu heatsink.)

I'm going to be getting either copper or some good quality thermal pads. If anyone can tell me where to buy either I'd love it. 
Also I'd like everyone's opinion about cooling for my m1710. I'm gonna lap it and get those thermal bits, but I'm also thinking of buying a blower that will fit inside and pull air from the battery socket and slot above the hd (adding to hd cooling) to blow under the video card and across the northbridge.

I don't have an exit yet, but was thinking either the top of the case, the back, or possibly use foam to direct the air out the top vent (found on the e1705's palmrest) on the left above the cpu fan, since heat rises and all that. 
I also have a 120mm 12V fan blowing directly on the ram at the bottom and pushing air across the bottom of the mobo already (it decreases ram temp by apx 7 degrees.)

Just wanted some advice and opinions mostly about what I can do and other heat improvements

Here's the blower I think may work

@Adam: Interesting idea to install fans into the battery.  I am guessing it is the 6 cell battery, not the 9 cell correct?  What is the wattage?  If it says 53WH, then it is the 6 cell - which would leave a lot of room for fans, yes.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Well, as I said I am attempting to convert my battery to a cooling center of sorts, and I've got a few pictures of my progress thus far. 

A few notes on how I plan on doing this:

1. I will be running 2 ANCIENT cpu fans sealed inside the battery case which will outlet air through a hole in the side of the case directly through an identical hole in the comp case and across the motherboard. 
2. I will power these old 3-pin fans using the built-n fan controller of my Thermaltake cooling pad. I plan on running the wiring through the inside of the comp case, exiting with quick-release connectors at either end, for easy disconnect. 

The plan is to get as much airflow through the case as is possible, and these fans are most likely just temporary, as i may be able to scale them up a little if I want to spend some money on the project (which I have yet to do, this is all junk I have lying around my dorm room). I'll post more pictures as soon as I get some more work done.

Here are those pics:

Very, very nice. I'm liking it, yes that hole in the battery slot is located perfectly.

That could actually become a very marketable product if it worked.

What are you gonna do with the extra cells? is there room in there?

I might just buy a spare battery for this,
the other way around I was thinking is actually making a battery pack to put a huge fan in, or a slim blower. 

Does it actually work? Or do you think a slim centrifical fan would be better?

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Wow, thanks for the support on this project, I'm glad to see that everybody likes my idea! Feel free to use it on your site, Matchbox, the more people that find out about it the better, right? 

I've made some updates to the project, and I took a few more pictures:


Just one thing, this is only a project to undertake if your are at least a little handy with your basic hand tools (power drills, squares, files, etc) although it could really be made a great project with access to a mill or even just an end mill on a drill press. I did this all by hand, and it shows, if you want a pro job, make sure you have the right tools.

To answer your questions Matchbox, I just tore out the old cells from the battery, and I've got them hanging on my wall in my dorm (they make a great ornament...) From what i have seen with my basic tests, this should work quite well, as long as i make sure everything in the battery case is sealed (so that there is only one air outlet). As you can see the fans I am using right now are... lacking... I will most likely upgrade as soon as I am sure this will work the way I want it to. I'll keep posting pics as I go, so you can see my progress, and hopefully this works out ok!]]></content>

Is it anyhow possible to flash an i9400 bios with the overclockable m1710 bios? i just got my lovely t7600g but i can't oc it because its not possible with the original i9400 bios.

Great site!!

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Maybe :P
There doesn't seem to be a difference in mobos, but it might need an xps bios originally on there to allow a flash...I dunno if it's even forceable.

I'd imagine it's considerably riskier though. If there is the slightest difference in mobos if it was to flash it would ruin the lappy.

However, I'm still somewhat confident it could be done. I'd be more comfy trying it with a warranty or spare mobo laying around. Alas I just have the m1710 and not a e1705 to try a force flash on.

You could always sell that cpu and get 400-800 bucks for it via ebay. (I got 400 CAD for my t7600.)

The M1710 A03 Bios is what you need for overclockiing, it can be found pretty easily on the dell site. Good luck if it will actually allow flashing on a different laptop make (only by name really).]]></content>

I am sorry to hear that.  Yes, the ATI X1400 is the base card you can get that can replace the FX2500 or any card in the 9300.  They make 128 and 256 versions.  Unfortunantly, I already sold mine or I would offer it up.  A quick eBay search should reveal a few; but, I would not pay more than $90 for one.

Good luck!

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[That card will not fit the e1705/9400. That card is for the smaller 15" version, the 1505. I recently took my friend's laptop apart and that is what he had (it was the e1505). The card you are looking for will look more like the one in the pictures on this site, but with only one heat pipe going off the the right. Keep looking, there are several available out there!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi guys, great site, i have learned a hell of a lot by just reading all the comments and such.

I just have a quick question though, i am definately planning on upgrading my 9400 to 4GB of ram, probably doing the graphics card too. But i was wondering if i should upgrade the processor too? According to CPUZ i am running an 'Intel Mobile Core 2 Duo T5500 @ 1.66GHz'. Is that enough do you think? I'm not planning to use it for super straining tasks, some gaming though...ok if i can upgrade it enough a lot of gaming.

Also i am thinking of maybe installing a new HDD, is that a reasonably simple task?

Thanks For any help]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Phil: You most likely want to upgrade the CPU to at least a T7200 - as it is the lower-end "4 MB L2 Cache" chips.  The one you have has 2 MB of total cache - and cache=speed when it comes to cpus. 

HDD is very easy.  Just two screws on the side, remove, replace.  It's a "SATA" drive, FYI.  The super-quiet 5400rpm 250 GB Hitachi mentioned in the comments above would be more #1 choice for the best speed-vs-power (and quiet!).]]></content>

Thanks for the reply. What sort of speed should i be looking for in the processor? I assume i want another core 2 duo one too? Also does my mother board matter when it comes to the processor...i mean i know it does, but are all 9400 similar motherboards, what im trying to say is will that processor that you recommended fit all 9400 motherboards? Is it difficult to install a new processor?

One more quick thing, i assume if i am replacing the hard drive (mine is a 100GB at the moment) that i will have to reinstall windows, if i can find the disk :S.

Sorry for all the questions. But thanks for any more help you can offer.

You'll see...I got this Inspiron E1705 a long time ago from another guy, and I wanted to upgrade its RAM memory...so I bought a couple of Kingston 1 GB DDR2 PC2-5300 667 MHZ Rams's so I could get 2 GB of RAM. The problem is that, once I installed them it still displays the 0.99 GB of RAM i has been displaying me this whole time. 
To make matters worst, I reallize that the previous Owner of the notebook tried to upgrade it by doing the same (I mean...it already had the 1 GB x 2 Rams installed, I thought it had 2 x 512 MB ).
By this point, I'm clueless...I've tried upgrading the Bios (to A09) but it still doesn't display my 2 GB...and im kinda getting upset!

What can I do? I'd appreciate your help VERY much!]]></content>

That works for both posts above, But as for an E1705 to have a 9 series card, it MIGHT work but it'd be limited, since unlike most bioses, dells are video card specific and don't support anything above a FX3600M as far as I know (and even that is limited support and a 7950 go gtx ends up being better).

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Richard: Try swamping the memory chips.  If you get 1 GB both times AND you are sure they are 1 GB DIMMs, then the physical slot may actually be damaged!  Try using 1 slot at a time to see which one is damaged.  Then, place the other DIMM into it and see if the same results happen.

@All-that-want-the-newer-cards: I agree with matchbox.  Dell's bios' are specific and anything pretty much not listed in these comments here will not work, or will work in a limited fashion.  There's only so much this 1705 baby can do.  :)

Hands down, the best results are with the older 7950 512 MB card.  Anything else is degregated in performance vs. value for-the-money.

I'm kind of wishing I had a 7950 now...  But, my 512 MB FX2500m is holding strong.  It's the 2nd best choice.

          <title type="text"><![CDATA[re: Why the Inspiron is a King]]></title>
          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Well, I think I have found the solution to all of our gaming problems. Over the past few weeks I have been trying to find the best way to overclock my 7950 GTX which I installed about 3 months ago. You may see my posts earlier where matchbox tried to help me flash the video card bios (thanks for the help by the way). But it would appear all of that was unnecessary. First some background:

Dell is notorious for releasing video cards with limiting bios's installed. They revert the clocks back to whatever the stock ones were set at, no matter what you do. This has been an issue that would appear to have only been remedied by risking a flash of the bios, which had as many possible negative effects as positive. This is an issue which I have finally found the solution for. Thank you online forums!!! THIS IS SO SIMPLE YOU WILL SERIOUSLY START LAUGHING!!!!!! I found this and just had to post about it!!!

Its this easy:
1a. Download the latest drivers (I am using the newest driver 179.48 beta)
1b. Download Ntune (I am using version 5.05.54.00)
1. Make sure invisible folders are visible
2. Open My Computer and browse to C:\Users\Your Name\App Data\Local\Nvidia Corporation\ntune\Profiles\sysdflt.nsu, and open the file with notepad, wordpad, or similar. (This folder structure will be different in XP or other, I did this in Vista)
3. You will see the following:

[BoardConfiguration]
Version=200
CPU=6f6
MCP=65535
SPP=65534
GPU=NVIDIA GeForce Go 7950 GTX

[ClockSettings]
FSBMHZ=0
AGPMHZ=0
PCIe2MHZ=0
TRAS=0
TRCD=0
TRP=0
GPUCOREMHZ=575
GPUMEMMHZ=600

[VoltageSettings]
CPUVOLTAGE=-1
NFORCEVOLTAGE=-1
MEMVOLTAGE=-1
AGPVOLTAGE=-1
AUXVOLTAGE=-1
CPUFAN=-1
AUXFAN1=-1
HTCPUSPPVOL=-1
HTSPPMCPVOL=-1
NFORCEFAN=-1
AUX1FAN=-1
AUX2FAN=-1
GPUFANPERIOD=0
GPUFAN3D=0
GPUFAN2D=0

You can see the two lines "GPUCOREMHZ=575" and "GPUMEMMHZ=600". These are the stock clock settings, although interestingly enough, some monitors read those clocks at half the speed (300/300). It gets confusing when Ntune is showing you two different core speeds! 

4. Simply change those two values to the values that you want, save them, close the text editor, and double click the file. Ntune should pop up saying that the settings have been accepted and vioala!!!! Overclocked!!!!

I currently have overclocked to 667/667 on my 7950 GTX. I do not want to go higher though, as gpu-z registered a change in temperature from 49-50 C to upwards of 70 C on the GPU during gameplay, so be VERY CAREFUL, you do NOT want to burn out your card! 

To give you an idea of the performance boost though, I tried to run Stalker: Clear Sky, a VERY graphics-intensive game, on low settings (1440x900, low settings on everything else) and it would lag to the point that it was unplayable. With the new settings, I was able to play with some lag at 1920x1200 on med-high settings!!!! 1440x900 with med-high was perfect!!! WOWWWWWW What an increase!!! 

The only downfall was the temperature increase, but there are ways to fix that. 

I did not change the other settings, but if anyone finds a better setup, please let me know, it could really breath life into this old laptop!!! Good luck, and dont burn up your laptop!!!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Haha, yeah I just realized something a little while ago from zzpulp on notebookforums, turns out that the latest drivers ALLOW overclocking to a limited range apparently. BUT only with the latest bios (which means that if you HAD flashed with the bios I had which is a version earlier, it would've worked but only for all drivers up to 169.04<---I think, can't remember which one it was).

I'm still running 84.69 drivers......very old, but I hate the new nvidia panel with such disgust. argh, I'm hoping to one day find time to just update to 94.24 or whatever it is and leave it at that.

Glad it worked out for you without the risk of flashing anyhow, :) kinda takes the risky fun out of it:P.

 I think having the battery compartment fan, having it angled up and with the hinge cover off (along with lapping the heat sink and AS5ing it obviously) would definately allow some serious overclocking. I've gotten mine up to 688Mhz core clock, but past that the voltage is insufficient, and I don't know of any mobile volt mods. :S. If I could do that and the battery fan thinger, I could probably pump up another 50mhz or so.

@Eric, your card pretty is a 7950 if I'm right and not too tired. I think the only difference was the clock speeds when tehy were built, so you could probably overclock too.

And some notes about this heat business, the cards are tough but anything past 90C isn't good times, it took a while, but my card finally commited suicide. Thankfully my new one can oc just a little cooler, but still, think of cooling first before thinking of oding on ocing :P.

Last thing I've noticed is that the T7600G cpu (for those depressed at not having it) proves to not be an advantage at all. I might get maybe 2-3fps extra, for a shat load of heat and constant throttling at 2.5-2.66ghz. It throttles based on it "thinking" it's overheating according to the dell tech, when overclocked it uses an algorithm to find out with the mofset and northbridge temps "should" be. So even if I put all the cooling in the world into it, it would throttle above 2.5ghz when under strenuous bus loads. (Meaning it WILL throttle in games, but NOT when doing something cpu intensive rather than gpu). So it's all in the graphics card and getting that thing cold and fast.]]></content>

Calibrate it how? like making it look as good as possible? Cause the nvidia control panel does a damn good job on with its colour correction. (Turn digital vibrance to medium, brightness and gamma to 80%, contrast to 100%, and you'll be very very pleased.)

The midrange 8 series GPUs, while having slower clock speeds, have more vector processors, so they are pretty on par with the high-end 6 and 7 series with a lower thermal output and less need for crazy heat pipes.

The 7950 go gtx still beats an 8600M or a 1600M, for two main reasons, the 8600M has limited bandwidth, and has slower general speed. 

Also for a note for everybody gaming, I've noticed that for some reason downclocking the cpu to 2Ghz yields a fair fps increase when overclocking the gpu. I think it's due to throttling at higher clocks when the bus is being stressed by the overclocked graphics. The sweet spot seems to be 1.6Ghz, anything below that cpu clock and you begin to get deteriorating preformace, but anything above 2.33Ghz also gives you bad preformance (cause it throttles to 50% workload about 1Ghz effectively, without letting you know, and you'll think it's merrily going at 2.33)]]></content>

The foil is mostly used to direct the airflow.

Now, if you can manufacture a steel plate about 1/8" thick, then yes that would work to dissipate the heat.  Aluminum is better; gold is best but if you have that much gold laying around - I'd think you'd do something else with it.  :)

I bigggtime doubt that getting a new cpu (a t7600 on ebay will be anywhere from 300-450 dollars) will do much for preformance. Getting a 3600M fx to work in there would boost preformance a lot, getting 2.33ghz, I really odubt you'll see anything more than a couple fps boost at the cost of possible throttling. Overclocking the gpu (if you as5ed it only!!) is the best way to pull frames from this lappy in my experience. (I have the t7600g now and have experimented alot with the clocks, and 2ghz cpu clock actually seems to be the best spot to be)]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Just a little update, 

I'm still at a loss here, my e1705 still gives me a BSOD with all the drivers that I tried. While doing some research, I found another person with a similar problem (here's the post: http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18252 ) and he called Dell. They said that because he didn't have an updated motherboard, the one he had, could not supply enough power to operate the 7900 GTX. The person didn't say when he purchased his laptop, but mine is from sep 2006. I'm wondering if that could be the problem?

I also found another post on the notebookforums http://www.notebookforums.com/thread205763.html that explained BSOD on a 7950 GTX on an e1705 and they explained that in order for the drivers to work, you had to delete one line that mentions Coolbits out of the .ini file. I did that and tried the drivers, but with the same result.

Anyway, let me give you the exact symptoms on my e1705:

- With the original card (ATI) it would go black screen right after the Windows screen.

- When I replaced the card to the 7900 GTX, I got a BSOD right after I logged on. That lead me to start it up in safe mode. If I uninstall the drivers and restart normally, the laptop will reinstall the drivers and soon after, go BSOD. 

- Then I restart in safe mode and uninstall the drivers and this is where I reinstall the modded drivers. Restart and BSOD right after log on. It's like an endless cycle.

My concerns are:
a bad card?
a bad motherboard?
not smart enough to find the right drivers?? JEJE

I think that the solution to this problem has to be something so simple that has been overlooked, anyway, I figured by reading this post that we can put or heads together to figure this one out. Thanks a lot for everyone's help and for posting so much great info. I've learned a lot about my e1705 these past few days!]]></content>

- Then I restart in safe mode and uninstall the drivers and this is where I reinstall the modded drivers. Restart and BSOD right after log on. It's like an endless cycle.

My concerns are:

a bad card?

a bad motherboard?

not smart enough to find the right drivers?? JEJE

I think that the solution to this problem has to be something so simple that has been overlooked, anyway, I figured by reading this post that we can put or heads together to figure this one out. Thanks a lot for everyone's help and for posting so much great info. I've learned a lot about my e1705 these past few days!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Winfrid: You are smart enough man!  You know that.

First, my system is dated Oct 2006, so don't believe the mobo jumbo that Dell told ya.

But, I do suspect something may be up with your system since the ATI dies as well after login/windows screen as you mentioned.

At this point in automotive diagnostics, we start to use the KGP method: Known Good Parts.  I would find another known-good-part of another video card.  Rather being another ATI or something less, something to see if it dies as well.  

Fyi, I played several games for a week or so on my original 90w power supply, but as the post mentions I almost immediately upgraded to the larger 150w.  So, no matter the size of the video card the 90w should at least satisfy everything but gaming.

If it was me, I would try to buy the original ATI off of someone that has upgraded.  And try that.  If it does the same thing, then I'd point to your mobo.  :(

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments Eric!! I feel like part of the family now! HA!!! 

Ok, I'll try that out, see if I can get a hold of another ATI card and try it out. I already got the 150W power supply in there. I'm getting a new battery since mine is out cause it went dead. Could that affect this whole process?

Also, I did swap a 1gb RAM stick for a 2gb RAM stick at the same time I replaced the card for a grand total of 3gb RAM. Thinking that was the problem, I swapped them back, but the rig behaved the same way.

As soon as I make any progress... or the opposite for that matter... I will post, and I'll also keep an eye out for your posts and your other posts too!! 

Thanks a lot man! Keep up the good work!!

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Question. I popped the heat sync off my old GPU and it uses the pads. How do you use AS5 when the pads are there?

Well, to answer my own question just 'cause I was a little "jumpy" to get my PC back together. After another round of dissasembly, the pads are actually underneath the PCB and possibly acting more of shock absorbers. After (what I thought was going to be.. destructively) popping off the heat sync it looks prety standard. Almost more of a epoxy look to it though, between the heat sync and the "whatever you call it". I assume at one point it was a thermal transfer compound, if anyone knows I'd love a shout. So, after seeing the prolific parts available like new keyboards and upper cases I think I'm gonna pop her back open and bust apart (insert scared face!) the GPU for some AS5. If ANYONE has done this I'd love a heads up. After lookiing at the max heat on the CPU and GPU both at 167°F I need to do something.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@ luke try updating the firmware / bios maybe?

@ ashhoe..

I have opened up the vcard assembly. It's pretty simple as intimidating as it does look. Be sure you have a T-9 I think (it's a small sized torx bit (star of david kinda shaped) ). You can get them at most hardware stores, I got mine as part of an electronics kit I bought for 20 canadian bucks. :P

So, once the card is out of the laptop (obviously) (to do this there are four screws on the mobo and you just pull by the spot that says push here, just incase you don't know), be sure to NOT try to pry it apart because the heat paste literally turns into epoxy shit. It is phase changing stuff, so all you need to do is first untighten all the torx screws in order (they won't come out just loosen all the way) get a hairdryer and beef its temperature up till about 70C (or where you touch it and it burns), then with oven mitts, take it apart (it'll be really, really easy, it'll almost fall apart). Simply scrape off the old gunk with your thumbnail, throughly clean with alcohol, lap if you want, then reapply the purple pads and put as5 on the gpu. Screw it together, pop the card back in and done like din din. Should be noticeably cooler and got 2 degrees cooler after a few days for me.]]></content>

The pads are on the bottom, right? My old GPU looked like all that needed to be removed was the heat sync itself, not the bottom part that the screws go into after passing through the PCB. I'll have to get another look at it but it seems like I could leave the GPU installed and just remove the heat sync and save a step. Also, how much AS5 would one expect to put on there?  ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[It would be a lot easier if you could just take the video card straight out, as long as you pull it from the push here spot (about one quarter of the way across the heat assembly from the left to the right when viewing when the videocard is at top right), it should be fine, and so long as the screws are undone holding it to the mobo. The bottom part doesn't have to be removed but it will naturally fall off (the pads aren't too sticky, they're meant more for heating purposes). 


You "could" just leave it in, but it's easier with the hair dryer and everything else if you take it out.

When applying AS5 to the gpu itself (it will be a little purple core saying nvidia on it) be sure to scrape off all that old crap compound, REALLY make it clean with 90% or higher isopropyl alcohol (can get it at a drug store)and wipe with a microfibre cloth. Then put a tad less than a sized grain of rice (the less the better really) right on the center of the gpu. Then put the heatsink back on evenly, put the backplate on behind the screw holes, and tighten by half turns the heatsink in the order of A,b,c and d until it's as tight as you can get it. Then line her up with the motherboard, press it down on the push here spot, and redo the screws to the motherboard and the vcard and you should be done. Be sure to clean your fans while your at it :P.

Only work in safemode, vgamode, and when there is no Nvidia driver installed.

I don't know if this still will be GPU or if bad luck some other problem.

As for your problem, does the system work with an external monitor?  If it does, then it could be the display.  If it doesn't, then it may be a bad card.  I would not pay $200 for a 256MB card.  There are several 512 MB versions out there for $250.

Odd how installing nvidia drivers kills the entire thing.  Makes me thing you got a knockoff or something.

If you scroll up a bit, you'll see some people install the T7600 cpu.  The cost is a bit high; so, I'd look more at the T7400.  

The basic rule is anything T7200 or higher, as these were the Core2 Dual Core with 4 MB of cache, which is 2 MB per core.  Anything slower than the T7200 has only 1 MB per core (2 MB total for the chip).

Cache = speed]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hello guys!

I just recently ordered a go7950GTX on Ebay for my E1705 and it's on its way to me as we speak!

I previously flashed the BIOS so that I could overclock my go7900gs.  I'm just curious if I will have to reflash my bios before I put the go7950GTX in, since Juan Lu's Bios disk has a specific file for the 7950gtx (795GTXUN.ROM).  If anyone who flashed their bios upgraded to a 7950GTX, can you tell me if you had any problems, or if you even had to flash your bios again?

Thanks!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I upgraded to the 7950 GTX a few months back, and to be honest I have not needed a BIOS flash. I just use Nvidia's Ntune to overclock the card from within windows. I probably can't get the same clocks or temps, but it is much, much easier and a whole lot safer and I knwo you don't want to lose that big $$$ card! Although if you still want to do it, I believe you will have to re-flash the BIOS, because if I am not mistken you are not flashign the BIOS of the computer, but that of the card. Ergo, it sounds as though you would have to re-flash with the new card. I hope that helps and i hope you have fun with that 7950, I know I do!

Also, Toban, if you keep your system in a cool room on a cooling pad etc, you should not see anything over 80C on your graphics card, that is generally where I get scared and slow it down. Once again, better to be safe than be stuck with a paper weight!]]></content>

The screen went black as to jump into screen saver mode I tried to get it to flash back on.  Nothing.  laptop beeps when i hit any key.  I restart it and there is vertical lines while the laptop goes through its bios check.  Lines would be best described as morse code looking. Laptop goes through rest of startup with these lines and when it enters windows there is a quick flash of artifacts in a half inch horizontal line across the middle of the screen then blackness.  I restarted it again in safe mode but still have the vertical morse code lines present in safe mode.  The card has been installed for 2 weeks and has been working perfectly fine to this point.  I will give it the night to "cool down" and see what happens in the morning.  any opinions would be appreciated.  Thanks]]></content>

A highend video card won't help you.  4 GB of memory can really help, to a point because of so many other performance issues with an OS installed for a long period of time.

Vista actually has surprised me.  I've got systems running almost 2 years straight with no format, and still running fast.  That's mainly due to the auto-defragging that Vista has, and the SuperFetch technology they built into Vista.

Okay, Eric got a question if you can help me out please. I am looking to install a second HDD into my inspiron 9400/e1705. I seen it being done through a caddy which replaces my CD-rom drive with one which takes a 2.5"HDD. Now, I have seen a few article on the RunCore Pro IV series of 2.5" SSD drives which are amazingly fast. I was looking to make them my main HDD and place my old 300Gb HDD in the CD=ROM caddy thingie. Now these SSD's are quite expensive and I was looking to get the 32GB version as opposed to the 64/128 GB options. Now I was wondering, is 32GB enough for Win XP/7 along with word/excel, photoshop and perhaps even aftereffects and premiere! (Well the last two I guess I don't need them on the main HDD). But is 32GB enough you reckon? Or should I fork out and get the 64GB, the 128GB and above are out of my spending bracket for sure. The wife would kill me.

Thanks in advance!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey guys,

I got a go7950 GTX on ebay, and the thing was dead.  I popped it in and it had artifacts all over the screen, and would not boot when drivers were installed.  I got it from a guy called corintosales.  I opened a claim with Paypal and they awarded it in my favor... just beware.

Anyways, now I'm looking to get another card.  I've read that the 7900 GTX (fx2500) and the 7950GTX (fx3500) are essentially the same card, it's just that the fx3500 is clocked higher.  Can I simply just get the fx2500 and overclock it and have virtually the same card as the fx3500?  Fx2500 are more common, and run cheaper, so that would be nice.

Thanks!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Avalach21 - People have overclocked the fx2500 a bit, but not to the level of the 7950.  I personally don't think the premium for the 7950 is worth is, considering  you can get a netbook for the same price and there are much better graphics cards in newer laptops these days.  Hate to say it, but the days of 7000 series GPUs are numbered for gaming.  I say this, cause I just got a 285 GTX for my desktop - and holy smokes.

@Loakii - I don't think a larger powersupply will help you there.  But, what we are talking about upgrading is that external "ac adapter/charger" for your laptop that you plug into the AC and into the back of your laptop.  The one the E1705 comes with is a 90 Watt unit.  But, the larger XPS laptops that came with the bigger graphics cards usually have 130 W or 150 W power supply units.  They are interchangable, so all you need to do is to search ebay for a "Dell PA-15 ac adapter".  Like this one pictured: http://tr.im/v3wB

eBay has them for about $30 to $40 new.

I almost always use the 130w, but when I bring it with me to work I use a 90w. A word of caution: if you have a similar setup as I do, DO NOT USE THE 90W POWER SUPPLY FOR GAMING. I have booted up STALKER Shadow Of Chernobyl while using the 90w, and 15 mins into playing: BEEP!!! my computer shuts down. This only happens when hooked up to the 90w (I have tried several, all with the same results) just beware that you will need to use the 130w+ at all times if you wish to game.

Thanks a lot for the writeup.  I used it a little over a year ago to upgrade to 4Gb of ram.  Now I fear I may need to use the GPU portion.

I'm having the same problem as you. Finding new cards for a decent price (college student here!) seems really hard.  Ebay has seemed pretty popular but is very iffy.

I have a fried 7900 gs go, and I'd like to replace it with something equally powerful or more powerful.

<P>2) Is it good idea to flash the card from fx2500m to be a 7900 GTX?</P>
<P>3) Any idea about GPU the fan? Should I change it too?</P>
<P>4) Any suggestion are welcomed :) </P>
<P>Thank you for all your help. Now I can see light at the end of the road.</P>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Jose:

Thanks for the props.  Sorry to hear about your system (seems so many have gone to dust).  To answer your questions:

1) Yes.  There are many bug fixes (fan controlling, cpu power management, etc).  A08 was the last big release A09 is just a minor update, no bugs.  But yes, update as soon as u can.

2) No.  Keep it the fx2500m.  The only reason to flash is to unlock/overclick the bios of the card itself.  Many here have done that, but it's only a 5%, give or take, increase.  IMO, it's not worth the possiblity of frying yet another card.  As you can tell by the article, I tend to lean towards stability over performance.  

3) A clean fan is a quiet fan.  :)  Should be pretty cheap to salvage an e1705 from eBay for another fan, and other parts.  If not, yeah I'd go $25 for another fan - not knowing how much they are.

4) The 7900GTX is nice.  The 7950 is a premium though, but sounds more like what you want for gaming.

I've also removed your email address.  If anyone here wants to contact him, please email me above.]]></content>

--

Hello everyone!  I will update my blog post above, but I wanted to give everyone a quick update.  

Finally, Windows 7 gives a true representation of memory, and how much is usable.  Unlike Vista and XP, it can see what is installed, and what the BIOS is allowing to be used.  My E1705, now with Windows 7 RTM, says:

4.00 GB Installed (3.25 GB usable)

I had Windows 7 64bit loaded when I saw this.  It got me thinking, the 32bit kernel in Vista could use up to 3.4 GB of ram.  So, why have the extra memory overhead of processing 64bit instructions, when I have no advantage of 64bit on the laptop!

So, I installed Windows 7 32bit, and yep, the same numbers were shown: 4.00 GB Installed (3.25 GB usable).

In other words, there is no need to run a 64bit OS on the E1705 with 4 GB of ram.  I did it before thinking I could squeeze out a little more.  Sadly, over the years since I made this blog post, I have come to learn that 32bit works just fine to address all of the memory here.

Now, if I can just justify spending $250 on 2x4GB sticks to "experiment" to see if the laptop can support 8 GB.  :)

Besides that, Windows 7 runs VERY well on the E1705.  There were ZERO drivers needed.  Windows 7 had all drivers for the E1705 (including the chipset).  Gamign is very well, with the WIndows Update version of the NVidia driver - so, not even the laptopvideo2go drivers were needed.

Even though I am sure gamers could eek out more performance if they were to use the laptopvideo2go drivers over the Windows 7 / Windows Update ones.  

Enjoy!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Skiaps :  Are you saying that you tried the card in an M90 laptop (which is kind of like the business-class version of the Inspiron)?

The 1500M/2500M/3500M Quatro video cards are supported and they work on the Inspiron.  

But, the 1600M/2600M/3600M have problems in the Inspiron E1705 laptops, and they do not work.  You may be correct about the voltage issues being the problem.  1600M is no for the E1705.

I suggest trying to find a Quatro 1500M card to use. 

Good luck!]]></content>

I'm having a very silly problem, I'm trying to install the mobileforce 92.44 drivers and I'm not able to properly overclock anymore with rivatuner (re-installed it of course). Any ideas?

Oh, and the best source for 7950gtxs are warranties. :P. I'm looking into building a battery compartment fan for my inspiron to cool it too, but want it to be able to have some battery power in it as well, so that'll happen one day maybe when I'm not doing so much school.

So eric, since I STILL have xp, do you think it's worth upgrading? Does it suck your cpu time a lot or anything? (even though I guess I could push 2.5ghz idle if I had to) OH and I recently found out a strange trick for making sure the laptop doesn't throttle during overclocking, I think it's a sensor somewhere that reads only on boot up, so long as that sensor is really cold, it won't throttle. Wierd? yes.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Matchbox: Welcome back.  :)  I really need to overhaul my blog to allow for better viewing/searching of these comments.  Anyhoot.

As for not being able to overclock with the drivers, I cannot answer.  Perhaps go back to the older ones?

Is it worth upgrading?  You are asking someone who formatted his Win95/98/ME/2000/XP machines every 4 to 6 months cause I could not stand the "slow-down" after things get installed.  Vista attempted to fix a lot of that with its prefetch algorythm, and worked quite well.  But Vista had issues with its UI that ate up some small CPU.  I really didn't have a problem with it.

Windows 7 changes the game entirely.  Besides fixing those UI issues, it has better power management such as the Apple-like dimming of the screen's backlight after like 1 minute (I love that), the ability to smartly-monitor the HDD and spin down - delaying certain normal reads, and the "Optimize Wizard" is an excellent tool that analyzes every setting your laptop supports and makes a very detailed list of things to change.  "Yeah, I may want my PCI Express at full speed for games, but not on battery".

All of these add up to now a 2.7 hour battery life for me during my commutes, on my ORIGINAL 9 cell battery that is still going strong, a solid 3 years now!  Compared to my community for years with Vista, I can tell a difference hands down that Win7 is far better at battery management.  

Makes me yern for my MBP again, but with Win7 for the power management to fix all of the problems Apple and Vista had under their POS drivers.

So, is it worth the ugprade?  Yes, because of the smart battery monitoring within Win7.  And, I like to stay cutting edge.  :)]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I thought I'd post some details of my recent Dell Inspiron 9400 upgrade.

A few weeks ago I was looking into buying the Broadcom Crystal HD decoder, as it supports full hardware acceleration of HD codecs, i.e. MPEG-2, VC-1 and AVC/H.264, enabling me to watch HD content on my Inspiron while keeping the CPU usage relatively low.

http://cgi.ebay.ie/Broadcom-BCM970012-HD-Decoder-Mini-Card-DELL-HP-ACER-UK_W0QQitemZ350261502421QQcmdZViewItemQQptZUK_Computing_Computer_Components_Graphics_Video_TV_Cards_TW?hash=item518d3661d5

As the Broadcom card is generally only available in mini PCI-E format, I would need to swap out the existing mini PCI-E Wi-Fi card and look for another Wi-Fi solution. Since I wasn’t using the expresscard slot for anything, I decided on buying the Belkin N1 Wireless ExpressCard.

http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=299617

Upon receiving both the Broadcom and Belkin cards, I carried out the necessary upgrades and ran a few tests on the Broadom card’s capabilities. Please see below for the results:

Blu-ray

Cars (H.264) - CPU usage (without Broadcom decoder) = 51-55%
Cars (H.264) - CPU usage (with Broadcom decoder) = 11-22%

Dark Knight, The (VC-1) - CPU usage (without Broadcom decoder) = 58-77%
Dark Knight, The (VC-1) - CPU usage (with Broadcom decoder) = 18-29%

X-Men: The Last Stand (H.264) - CPU usage (without Broadcom decoder) = 52-61%
X-Men: The Last Stand (H.264) - CPU usage (with Broadcom decoder) = 14-25%


HD DVD

300 (VC-1) - CPU usage (without Broadcom decoder) = 49-77%
300 (VC-1) - CPU usage (with Broadcom decoder) = 18-40%

Batman Begins (VC-1) - CPU usage (without Broadcom decoder) = 61-83%
Batman Begins (VC-1) - CPU usage (with Broadcom decoder) = 22-46%

Transformers (H.264) - CPU usage (without Broadcom decoder) = 91-100%
Transformers (H.264) - CPU usage (with Broadcom decoder) = 15-54%


Given the reduced CPU utilisation, I couldn’t be happier with the results. I am also pleased that I can get even more life out of my 2 year old laptop than I originally thought.

I hope that any other Inspiron 9400 owners can benefit from the information above.]]></content>

Sorry, but can't think mauch.  There are several several options that can get screwed in your audio.  Sounds like you'd done a lot already.

If you are wanting a mic for like video conferences, then get a headset with one built in.  Like gaming headphones, as they usually have a mic built-in for multiple-player online games. 

The important part is to order one with USB connection, not standard 1/8" stereo jacks.  This is because the ones with USB connections have an integrated Sound Card, and does not use your laptop's sound card (Logitec make a lot). ]]></content>

http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins9400/en/sm/index.htm

You can see that the system board only has a few removable parts, such as the video card and memory.  That's about it:

http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins9400/en/sm/sysboard.htm#wp1000473

But, I find it odd that Dell does not have a global unlock key/sequence like most other manufacturers.  There aren't any jumpers on the mobo to reset the bios either (that I know of).  I would call support again and ask for a 2nd tier representative.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I've been reading this forum, but have never posted.  I recently had to give up on my E1705 since Dell was unable to fix the video problems.  First the graphics card went, then the LCD.  For some reason after replacing almost every component, there were still problems and Dell decided to finally just send me a refurbed Vostro 1720.  Though I now have a new computer in lieu of the 3 year old E1705, I still miss features in the E1705.  For instance, the speakers are not as good (missing bass boost); does not have dvi port, colors on LCD are inferior, and just not as classy looking (it's a black box, very business like).  Anyway, I did manage to get a blu-ray player, 4 GB ram, and the Vostro came with a webcam.  The E1705 had far less computing power, but it was a good computer.  One basic question to the community--should I be happy that I got this replacement or should I seek Dell out in making me "whole"?  I paid $2600 for the e1705 in May 2006 and now I get a $1200 laptop.  Am I crazy?  I've even started looking on ebay for a used E1705.  I have a hard time letting things go, obviously. ]]></content>

Another thought - offer it as a trade with someone on eBay or Craigslist.  "I just loved my E1705.  Here, take a new machine in exchange."  Problem with that is if you want the upgraded 7900gtx or 7950, you're going to have to pay for it in addition.  

As a matter of fact, "I" would be interested in a trade (yes, the very machine you see in the pics, with the 7900gtx)!  (depending on the specs).  ;) Email me: me -at- eduncan911.com

Thanks for the insight.  Unfotunately, since I received a replacement I already had to return the E1705 to Dell.  I guess I'll just keep what I have.  The new Vostro has a Nvidia GeForce Go 9600 MS card with 512 MB.  Also, ram is expandable to 8 GB.  I should be real happy really since technically I didn't have a warranty anyway (their records indicated that I had a warranty still when I had in fact already cancelled it and had a refund).  Crazy thing is I will have a warranty on the new Vostro for another 2 years since my "warranty" transferred to the replacement, too.  I'm happy now.  Really enjoy your blog anyway.

In my case I did not see a dell logo either, but I could tell my screen was on and that my pc was booting fine. After lots of research online and getting to the point where I believe I shelled out so much $$ for a bad card, I was able to find a solution.

Since I did not have an external monitor available, I used remote desktop from another machine and was able to access my E1705 with the 7900gtx in it. I knew this was a longshot but had to give it a try anyyway, so I installed the forceware 167.51. Lo and behold when the driver was finished installing and I rebooted the laptop, yep Dell Logo and everything works perfectly.

I do not know if connecting an external monitor would've worked also. I am surely happy I did not give up on this just yet.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi all!

I have been reading this thread with great interest and because of it I have upgraded from 1 GB to 4 GB SDRAM, T2350 to T7200 and OC'ed 7900 GS to v1.24/600/800.
Everything works great... except for the temperatures. The CPU holds ~45 C at idle which I think is OK, but GPU idles at ~70 C with no fans running (testing purposes only).
I tried to remove the heatsink from the 7900 card to apply fresh AS5, but it was stuck and I didn't want to pry it away. I think the high GPU temperatures is a result of my attempt to remove the GPU heatsink. Any tips for removing the GPU heatsink without breaking the card?

Best regrards

Hopefully someone who has done it here will reply, as I have not done it myself.

I would think prying is ok, if you work yourself around the edges of the heatsink, slowly applying the same pressure.  

I have seen some heatsinks on OEM machines stick as well.  It's unnerving to pry, but you have to at times - that gunk is stuck.

Good luck!]]></content>

There are only a few thermal pads under there with contact on the memory chips along with some old thermal paste on the GPU. There is really nothing that should cause need to pry.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Well, in theory it works that way.

I took my gpu apart, you do take the card out first, then use a T-8 torx 8 bit, which you can find at hardware stores (They make it tough, and believe me, I tried using phillips :P no workie.) to undo all the screws.

It won't magically pop off yet.

There's phase changing material on the gpu, and if you pry at it, it will most likely crack the fucking card. Best thing to do is use a hairdryer on it for about 5 minutes on high (the heatsink, just so it reaches operating temps :P ) and then use oven mits to take the card apart. It'll just fall apart then.

Then you can just do the good old clean, smooth it down with 1000 grit sandpaper, clean again, and apply as5. Then you just put it all back together. If you have arctic ceramic you can replace the crap purple pads, but alas I didn't, thus I didn't.

Eventually I hope to get windows 7 on here, and I'll use that as an excuse to take the entire thing apart again and make some interesting upgrades to accompany overclocking the cpu and gpu again to remain somewhat current. :P Along with FINALLY upgrading my drivers.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[For the record, the gpu radiator setup seems to be pretty bad too, it builds a lot of heat in there. One of the things I'm going to do which someone on here did a long time ago is to make a hold in the hinge cover, elevate the laptop permantently, and make a new battery pack which contains a (very limited) battery, and a fan to blow into the tiny hole that goes right over the video card. With some foam taped down, I'm kinda hoping to make baffles that do that properly. 
Frick maybe I'll just leave the hinge cover off.

Or just get long wires, take the thing apart and leave it outside in the cold canadian winter while I have a monitor keyboard and mouse inside...

Anyway, with a pair of earmuffs I tried again and I finally managed to separate the heatsink from the card itself. After cleaning, applying AS5 and reassemblying I checked the temperatures. The GPU peaked at 45 C after 30 minutes of idle. This with I8kfanGUI running. I'm happy. :)

@Matchbox: I have been running W7 Home Premium 64-bit for a couple of days now and I really like it. Windows found every driver except GeForce Go 7900 drivers and something called PCI\VEN_1180&DEV_0592&SUBSYS_01CD1028.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Jon: Congrats on the ear-muffs man!  :)  Hehe, and for getting the temps down.

Note: As I corrected in a comment above, 64-bit does nothing for these laptops except use more memory.  Especially under Windows 7, it tells you the truth (finally) that "4.00 GB (3.25 GB usable)".  

When I installed the 64bit version, I saw this and was like.. "Humf.  I wonder if 32bit does the same".  Sure enough, I installed the x86 (32bit) version of Win7, and it said the exact same thing: "4.00 GB (3.25 GB usable)"

64bit is needed if you are going to address more than 4 GB of ram for your programs.  Since 64bit reserves twice as much memory address space for each 32bit application (i.e. under WOW64), this actually wastes memory on a system with less than 4 GB of ram.

Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit idle after boot: 684 MB
Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit idle after boot: 411 MB*

*Note that the kernel is 64bit, and only a handful of startup apps are 32bit - hence why there is no 1:2 ratio.  The 1:2 ratio shows when you start running lots of 32bit programs - i.e. Games.

Big difference, especially when you start running larger programs.

Bottomline, for this Dell E1705, just install 32bit OSes.  There's no point to install 64bit, unless you just want to run it for the hell of it (knowing it is using more ram for each 32bit program).]]></content>

@Anyone...

Anyone have any clue if I can find 2 2gb sticks of 667mhz ram? for the inspiron obviously, for roughly ohhhh 60 bucks? Anywhere? or am I going to have to wait.
I'd rather blast from 2 to 4gigs of ram on this before upgrading to win7. I'm looking to spend 150 bucks upgrading the laptop. Including price of ram and the battery thingy. Also, if anyone has any shitty batteries for the inspiron they want to sell to me, I'll buy it for a few bucks. Even if it holds zero charge.

@Tony

Well the best you can do for cooling is replace the thermal paste and sand it a bit. Other than putting new fans inside or making it watercooled. (Which could be done if you decided to cut your heatpipes inside)
The best processor you can get is the T7600 (SL9SD!!!! ONLY!!!) which is 2.33ghz.
Technically you should be able to put the T7600G inside, but I don't have an extra inspiron lying around to test a bios flash on.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Adam! HEY welcome back! You should really get on notebookforums man. There's lots of guys who do mod stuff on there.

I looked at some of that ram already :) I decided to get 800mhz ram, and it should just downclock to 667, but it '"should"' also automatically tighten it's timings. Haven't got it yet, off of ebay.

Also bought a shitty battery and a bunch of AWESOME ram cooling pads, which I plan to use in this mod, for next to nothing. It's fucking sick, they're bits of copper that act as heat sinks, and guess what! If it fits on the video card, it'll make your mod even MORE effective.
Thats what I'm going to spend 2 days doing these holidays. Upgrading to Win7, overclocking the cpu to 2.66 finally, redoing AS5, installing 2 new fans into the inspiron, putting new drivers on for the gpu, adjusting the memory timings (which I found a good way of doing and get some actual interesting results).

So alot :P But yeah, the battery mod idea in my opinion is one of the best out there so far. The only thing that might be better is if it could be a portable water cooling unit. (the battery) I have a fucking insane small fan to put in the batt when it gets here. Just one thing, did you ever find out how to power the fan via the battery charger / circuitry of the battery itself? That would be killer.

OH and for everyone, there's an interesting tidbit that I uncovered. I heard a lot of rumours about getting dx10 cards in our inspirons. I had the chance to find out if it's true. However since the dell bios is soooooo locking, it only allows a few video cards, and rarely any post-preduction. I got the fx1600M WORKING in my m1710. Yes, with dx10 through the alpha xp hack.

However, it would be a kickass card IF;
1) the heatsink were smaller
2) didn't draw 50W
3) had a 256 bus

Right now it's limited by it's bus, and the 7950 actually beats it in a lot of the games I play, especially if I overclock it.
I'd love to get the fx3600M in there, it would fit, but apparently due to lack of bios support, it's severly downclocked and brightness control is lost. (I was talking on the forum about a hardware workaround)

anyways thats the update.
So the 7950 go gtx is still the best :( for it.
Umm also, does anyone know the exact art of getting powermizer working right for nvidia cards?]]></content>

I just missed the T7200, but I see I can get a T7300 for same price. I have a bid in on another T7200 so I best wait to see what happens there 
Earlier in this forum there were questions as to whether the Dell coudl handle the 8--MHz FSB. So you say any of the CPUs up to T7600 is ok right?

The Dell A10 BIOS should be on the downloads page, make sure you browse to it using model selection, not service tag. If you have an ATI card in your comp, the new BIOS may not show up as it is a change for Nvidia Card Laptops. From what I can see it is just changing the thermal recognition settings on Nvidia cards so that they dont overheat. If you use I8KFanGUI, then you should not need this update as you are doing what it is changing manually (if that makes sense). I'm gonna stear away from the update for now as I'm pretty sure I dont need it. If you still want it though, here is a link:

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hey, for those of you who plan on using Windows 7 on this here baby make sure you use the drivers provided directly from Nvidia. I tried both and saw a GIANT performance increase from the Windows-provided to the Nvidia-provided drivers on my 7950 GTX. Also, Nvidia's drivers now make use of the auto-downclock feature that should save you a little power as well. Just keep an eye on your temps, that baby runs a lot hotter with these drivers for some reason (even with both fans maxed manually), so just keep an eye on it. Mine runs up to 83C while running Mass Effect maxed out, which is kinda scary, so just stay on top of your temps.]]></content>

@Vermicious: The mobos with integrated videos cannot be upgraded.  Your best bet is to get a different mobo with a pcie slot - so you can buy your own video card.  

Best place to hit is eBay for 'broken' E1705s, or just the mobos.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Adam: Great find!  And an AWESOME price!

@Derek: You can use the 90w PSU, I do as well when I am travelling cause the 130/150W PA13/PA15 units are litterly the size of a brick!

Just, do NOT play any games that use the video card or anything that uses 3D modelling. Watching videos is just fine, as that is not modelling.

But hackers/piraters be careful.  The good news about the geForce 79xx series (and 98xx, 285 series) is that they support h264 hardware decoding.  This codec is used for HDTV, and Blu-ray/HD-DVD decoding.  By default, most Video Players will use the CPU, which chokes down on 1080p HDTV pirated files (like mkv and mp4s that are encoded with x264).  This won't hurt anything with the 90w PSU.

But, the Haali splitter (my favorite) does use any hardware decoding of h264 if present (i.e. the video card), so you can watch anything!

The downside to the video card decoding?  Uses more power, and gets hotter.  I have risked it with my 90w PSU, and it seems to be ok.  But I know I need to be careful.

If you're willing to shell out 300 bucks, it's possible to yet again, upgrade your inspiron. Not sure how worth it it is, but you can now apparently get the 3600m in there. It's bigger, but fits. AND now has a bios upgrade allowing cooler cards and support for this card apparently.

3600M = g92 = 8800 gtx
....I know.

about twice as good as the 7950gtx,....while overclocked.
maybe when they give an upgraded bios for the m1710 I'll do that too.

Still haven't gotten the parts for my mod and have no time anyways so again it's been pushed back]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Jon: Holy crap, you're right about the "3" ANT connections.  Sorry about that!  I would find an old Dell 1500 - 1505 wireless card then (it's what I have in my dell 9400, the Dell 1500 Wireless).  The 1505 version had some minor updates, and works as well.

Looks like they are going for about $30 on eBay.  :)

Thanks about the 802.11n post.  Note, 802.11n goes up to 230Mbps, where 802.11a (what your card currently supports) goes up to 115 Mbps over the 5.8 Ghz radio.

Also note: Most 802.11n routers allows n OR a connections over 5.8 Ghz.

So, the only major benefit you'd get upgrading from your current card to an "N" card is double speed on 5.8 Ghz routers (if you have no rooms blocking your signal, note from my blog where 5.8Ghz is great for getting away from interferances - but at the risk of getting blocked by things suck as WALLS or furniture).

Or, 4x the speed over 2.4 Ghz radio (802.11g @ 54 Mbps vs 802.11n @ 230 Mbps).]]></content>

<P>My E1705 is 3 years old, and the warranty has JUST expired. It's been a real workhorse, and I love it. About 18 months ago, I started playing an online game you may be familiar with, called Second Life.

<P>So, at first I had no problems running things on there, but as time has gone on, it is getting more and more difficult for my laptop to cope with the graphics on there. I would really like to try a graphics card upgrade and see if it helps.</P>
<P>I'm a novice at this, although my husband and I are both adept enough at following instructions and doing research that we can try this ourselves (I think). &nbsp;If you or anyone reading this thinks that would be foolish and we should find a pro to do the work for us, please say so! &nbsp;However, I'm willing to take the risk, and would like to know what particulars to watch out for. In other words: if we will need to replace or modify anything else other than upgrading memory and changing the graphics card, please let me know!</P>

I'm having the same problem with my laptop.

Try getting rid of all the dust inside first, then follow up by doing a good old defragmentation.

Eventually it's better to just wipe the drive and start anew.

@Tommy T
Go to notebookforums and post your question there, there's  alot more knowledge, you can go to my website for the essentials you will need. I believe the procedure for flashing from quadro to geforce is fine, just not the other direction.

@William
At risk of it being stolen, contact dell and give them the service tag. If the seller can't help you out you should get a refund. There MAY be some backdoor passwords, but dell updates that with a08 and I know the old one doesn't work anymore (it's essentially starting the notebook in factory mode)
Dell is your best bet for help. There ARE hardware ways around this, but it takes a lot of effort, the chip holding the password is NOT the same as the bios chip.

@Anyone, does anyone know how to get the damn battery packs apart correctly? Can anyone tell me a good procedure?

I've just completed following all the instructions apart from installing the new graphics card (as I have a nvidia go 7900gs and can't find a cheap enough upgrade). However my laptop was heating up hugely so being about to take out the GPU and find that there was a load of gunk between the heat sink and the fan that I could take out solved the problem (applying the AS5 probably also helped).
Now have 4GB (3.25 avail) of RAM, 500 GB 7200 rpm HD and a much cooler laptop; thanks.

Only one question (just in case I come across a cheap GPU) is the Quatro FX2500m 512MB the very best GPU that will fit or is there an even better one around that I could try?]]></content>

Thanks, I will try that first.  We replaced the keyboard about 9 months ago, and the laptop hinges about 2-3 months ago.  Keyboard was on our own, hinges by a tech.  Both while we were still under warranty.  Now...we are not. ::)  But a good clean up of any gunk in the hardware and a decent disk defrag cannot hurt.  I hate to wipe the disk, but it might be the best thing.  I am going to do a lot of backing up this week to be sure I don't lose anything.  

After that, though, I still want to try upgrading.  I love the machine, and I want to keep it for a while longer.  If any other SL players have thoughts, please feel free to speak up!]]></content>

I have the FX 2500M in my laptop, my 7900 GS fried and i got the quadro on ebay.
You can get the FX 3500M, but it's gonna cost you much more and you get just a little more performance than the 2500M overclocked, don't bet on much higher overclocks on the 3500M. As far as i know, the 3500M only has higher stock clock.

But then you may take your chances on a 3600M wich would me MUCH better (DX10, PhysX, CUDA, etc)
But as you can read higher, there are some issues and it's gonna cost you!

Thanks for your comments. Yes, the main reason I haven't upgraded the graphics card is the cost/benefit ratio as the 7900GS seams pretty good; particularly now that it is running cooler.

I'll have a look around for the 3600M though, maybe I'll get a good deal. Its so tempting to do the upgrade now that I've seen the insides of my machine!]]></content>

What a great place for e1705'ers!!!
I'd like to get you guy's ideas about my lappy's status.

E1705
t2300@1.6ghz
1Gig RAM
Radeon-X1400
WUXGA1080p
80G-HDD-5,400rpm

I used to be able to watch 720p but now i cant watch many of them (depends on the encoding), for sure not 1080p mkvs.

1.What should i upgrade in order to be able to watch 1080p mkvs smooth? cpu\gpu\ram

2.What upgrade will benefit better preformance in general?



THANKS!]]></content>

I had a question about upgrading my memory on my Dell E1705. I just got my 4gb (2x2gb). I have trouble posting when I have the 4gb install. It just hands on the Dell logo screen with the bios loading screen 1/4th of the way full.

Do I have to upgrade my bios and upgrade to Vista/Win7? I'm running 32bit XP along with Bios Revision A08.

Will upgrading to Bios Rev A09 allow me to run my current XP settup with 4gb installed? Im aware that I can only use about 3gb on XP. Any help is appreciated. Thanks for looking]]></content>

@Rene
I haven't tried it yet, I'll let you know. It's probably a good idea to stick to memory that 667mhz, and only ddr2 will work up to 4gb. Just so u know. Also no matter ur os, you'll only see 3.25 since the northbridge is 32 bit based and will only access that much.

@Lior
Ummmm. Not too sure, nvidia gpus tend to have hardware support for that kind of thing. I've yet to find a dell form factor 3600M that'll fit my laptop, but I think and %500M version will work and they're much easier to find. Either that or go for a cpu upgrade. All your codecs and good right? Be sure to download optimized 1080p codecs too.

That is correct.  Win7 x86 (32bit) and x64 (64bit) both found the card and install decent drivers.

@Everyone:

And I said it before, and I'll say it again.  Just install 32-bit version of OS.  Since there is only 3.25 GB usable, you will actually be wasting a little memory with the larger block sizes of 64bit.

@KennySVG
 yup 3-5C makes sense if the card was downclocked by the default vga drivers :) Gaming might not be horrible but it's best to go with nvidia or laptopvideo2go's drivers.

@Eric
Thanks for the kind words mate, I shed a man tear of appreciation :P

@Camero, even if it's a different form factor, it DOESN"T mean the card won't work. All that matters is that it fits.
Go here to see what cards have been tested with what and what have worked.
http://www.notebookforums.com/thread230162.html

@Everyone / Anyone who knows

Just some follow up, the battery mod had a LOT of issues working correctly. I've decided to either buy or build an expresscard slot fan and a hot air extractor, then build baffles with foam and make, yes make, a radiator, because I'm going to attempt to force the fx 3600M to work, just to get one last kick out of the inspirons.

And yes, I was wrong, the nvidia tables were updated with A10 but strangely it didn't provide support for the 3600M.

So here's my idea and what I need help on.

I need,
A piece of rectangular copper about 1"x4" and the thickness of a regular copper shim.

More AS5 :P duh.

An easy way to make holes in the hinge cover without weakening it too much.

to know how to adjust the voltage coming from a dell 150W power adapter through soldering to go from 0-apx12V.

To know if the INVERTER on the LCD PANEL controls brightness through voltage, and if so, if it can be seperately powered directly from the ac adapter with the voltage mod as per above.
That last one is key to beating this things issue. It works and even gives good scores in an inspiron, it's just the damn lack of inverter control.

I may also try an inverter from an M6300 to see if it's more the inverter than the system bios lacking support for gpu brightness control.

Any answers and help would be appreciated. The battery pack fan mod didn't pump enough air into the chasis to be a good enough case fan, but the idea is solid, if the hinge cover is completely off.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi again everyone:

I'm starting to get things together to do this mod on my 1705....I wound up recently purchasing a new PC, so I feel safer knowing I have a reliable computer to use if I goof up anything while I make changes ;-)

In a reply to me above, Matchbox mentioned that a good physical cleanup of the machine's interior would be a good starting point. I think that is very wise, since it may help performance now and will also help eliminate any problems with the mod caused by dust and so on. If anyone knows of a good list of instructions on doing this for a 1705, I would be very grateful. 

 I'm very new to this, and would love a website or blog that walks you through it step by step.  I've checked the Dell site, and although I can get specs on removing the cover and so on, what I find about cleaning is a bit vague to me. And, there is the timeless question "Do I dust or vacuum first, and with what brand of furniture polish?"  :-D  I do know to not use anything like that, lol, but I'd love an overview of the basics, and some tips on what to do if I find anything that is particularly stubborn....as well as someone to point out "This may look like dirt, but it isn't so leave it alone!"

I will look up graphics cards and memory this weekend, as well as the cost of an upgrade or brand new install to Windows 7. (@Eric: thanks again for that tip, I agree it is a good starting point!)  I'll give a shout when I ahve more info.

Thanks very much,

Actually, I didn't see any performance or clock speed differences with the different drivers. I had compared the Win 7 drivers to the LaptopVideo2Go modded inf driver. Performance was about the same, 3d Mark scores were about the same also. The only difference was the temperatures. When I was using Win XP, the same occured for Dell Drivers vs LaptopVideo2Go.

I like your ideas with getting the FX3600M into the E1705. I already chickened out after getting the same brightness issue with the A10 bios and instead bought a used M6300 with a bad FX3600M on ebay. When it arrives I'll drop in my FX3600M which I had also grabbed on ebay for $170 (Dell sealed refurb). Of course I'm gonna bake the FX3600M that's in the lappy now to breathe some new life into it; From what the seller described, usual artifacts that the 7900 series was also famous for.]]></content>

No vaccumming, and no unnessicary overspeeding of the fans.
The inspiron is pretty easy to do, but for a step by step there is a service manual on the dell website

there you go.
The hardest part is honestly the hinge cover, and that's just fear. Be sure to rub a good magnet on a screwdriver to magnetize it, and take out your harddrive and battery! :)

You'll see the dust bunnies in there, just remove with fingers, clean with compressed air and isopropyl alcohol 95%ish. That should be enough to bring temps back down.

@KennySVG
Where'd you get your m6300 3600m from which ebay guy? I'm attempting to contact a chinese company and a ukrainian guy for them. And for how much? And which drivers provided the lower temps? (Possibly just the activation of powermizer but still) I've just never seen a precision 3600m on ebay. Only the mxm version for asus.

I apologize but this blog post is about upgrading (hacking) the hardware of the Dell 1705 laptop.  Not really a debug forum, as there are so many reasons why you may be getting that screen.

Others may have some websites to suggest.  But, I recommend inserting your Windows disk and boot off of it, choose Repair and let it repair the startup files.

Outside of that, or if you don't have the disk, there are dozens upon dozens of issues that can cause that.  From viruses to spyware to bad disk sectors to deleting the wrong files.  It's just too much to list and/or support here.

If you are not able to perform any of these diagnostics, I recommend taking it to your local Office Max where they do PC repair for a minimal fee.

Thanks, that does help!  I've replaced the keyboard on this machine once, and had to remove the hinge cover to do that.  You are right, there is a fear factor... "OMG, it's gonna snap in half!" Slow and steady pressure wins the day.  Removing the hard drive...::gulp::  I can manage it though.  

And I agree with Eric, a huge thank you to Matchbox for being so helpful, and to everyone contributing on here, it is great to watch people come together and help each other like this :-)

@Jabrie:  I have tried the Dell Support forums before, and found them to be very helpful.  They do have one forum for software issues, and another one for spyware/virus/malware/etc.  Perhaps you could ask there and get some feedback on your issue; based on Eric's observations, it sounds like it might be a good place to start.

I posted on here earlier as I performed an upgrade on the basis of this page. My GPU fan failed a few weeks ago and on the basis of the confidence I gained from this page I diagnosed the problem, ordered a second hand fan on ebay (the fans, at least new ones in the UK appear to be very hard to find !) and it seems to have solved the problem. So thanks for a second time.

I've also recently installed Windows 7 on my Inspiron and I'm loving it. Luckily the x1400 can still handle all the Aero graphics fine, so transparency is not a problem; not bad for an ancient GPU.

I plan on cleaning out my laptop eventually and replacing the TIM on both the CPU and GPU to drive down temperatures, but as I only have one laptop, and I use it as my main computer, I'll have to wait a while longer. Until then, I'll just keeping using compressed air to get rid of any dust by the air vents.

Interesting.  It would seem you have a slightly different brand of a 7900 GTX 512MB.  You can find your card here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA_Quadro#Mobile_applications

It would seem you have a nearly identical card!  The card which I have, and others here is spec'd as such:

Quatro FX 2500M 512MB
--
CPU Type: G71GLM
Core Speed: 500 Mhz (stock)
Memory Speed: 600 Mhz (stock)

The card you have is spec'd as such:

Quatro NVS 510M
--
CPU Type: G72GLM (newer generation)
Core Speed: UNknown
Memory Speed: Unknown

Sadly, the wikipedia article doesn't list the core and memory speeds.  Take a look at the entry for the NVS 300M.  It lists the speed of 450/500.  I'm willing to bet yours is clocked the same as ours, at 500/600.

Also note one big change: your NVS 510M is available with up to 1 GB of ram!  The older 2500M/3500M series is capped at 512 MB.  Nice.

Want to make your first Wikipedia entry?!?!  I do!  :)  Here's how, we need to get the stock timing speeds of your NVS 510M.  Download this app, called GPU-Z (just like CPU-Z, but tells you about your video card):

http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/

Write another comment here, or email them to me (using the Contact link in the header).  Would love to edit a Wikipedia entry.  :)

Enjoy! -E]]></content>

No, you can't upgrade the card.  The memory is part of the card itself.  You'd have to find a 1 GB video card version of yours (and I am guessing that won't be cheap).  512 is more than enough fo rhte 7900.  You're fine.]]></content>

I just got a Quadro 3600M, so I'll see about getting it to work inside this beast when I get my new HD and therefore Win7. The 7950go gtx is still not bad, it beats out current Class2 cards. But I mean. I get 3d Mark 05 scores of close to 11,000, and the newer cards rape that benchmark with more than double that score. The 3600M also rapes it there too. Anyone with electronics experience I'd love to get help from you. 
I'm also looking for a sort of shim for the gpu card itself, a very thin piece of copper thats also fairly long (my idea is to have it long enough to be going right out of the gpu cards radiator and act as an almost direct radiator to the gpu before it hits the heatsinks. I'll be AS5ing some Ram copper heat sinks onto that strip of metal, supporting it with foam and hopefully getting a fan that can blow air through the expresscard slot to get airflow right past this new radiator for this new gpu. Plus making a new exit point which will essentially be a shit load of little holes in the hinge cover.

I need someone with electronics experience because the card isn't compatible with the inverter I have and I need a way to feed the exact current and voltage to the inverter itself with the ability to change the current I give it as I so choose with either a seperate circuit or something simple. OBviously the simpler the better. Even If I could have a switch to change between gpu controlled (lowest brightness) and my circuit or what not (highest brightness) that would even work. I don't care if it's pulling current off of the AC adapter, or USB ports, or wherever else. Just could use some ideas and help. The card will work, just with no inverter control at all. Apparently newer inverters don't help and it's more a bios issue.

Well, scroll up 2 or 3 comments and you'll see that Mike has a NVS 510S that works in the 1705 - and it's available with up to 1 GB of ram.  The 1 GB may be helpful if you have a 120hz monitor, but that's about it.

But no, there are no DX10 cards for our machines - much less a DX11 card.  Just time to upgrade machines if you want them.

The fx 1600m is the equivilent of a 8700gt, dx10, and will work completely. It's preformance is on par with the fx2500m though.

Still working at getting the fx3600m (8800m gtx) to work in this.
By the way, anyone with an overclockable cpu (t7600g) can now use them in your e1705s and overclock using a program called throttlestop. Even without bios support. Oh how things change]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@BlacRayne00: The 3500M shouldn't have any issues, from what i can remember.  It's the 3600M that has brightness issues.

The 2500M is a 7950 GTX core. Some seem to have better luck with a card designated as "2500M" instead of just the plain "7950 GTX".  Can't say for sure why though.

As for is it work upgrading?  Well, memory will run ya about $50.  The card, maybe $150 if you watch eBay.  

If you don't have at least the Intel 7200 CPU ($90) (or 7400 or 7600 - $130), then you can do for a CPU upgrade as well as the 7200+ series has 2MB of cache.  But really, the newer series quad core laptop cpus start at 3MB of cache and go up from there, for comparison.  Prices are from http://pricewatch.com  Search for "Intel 7200".

So all in all, that's about $350 upgrading w/CPU plus time tracking things down.  With the risk of bad video cards on eBay (seems to be a common issue).

Single best upgrade though is a SSD drive.  The battery life, plus boot times is really nice! The good news is you can use the SSD in all newer laptops, when you upgrade in a few years.

It's a nice laptop, but I am thinking of selling mine from this blog post actually.  It's been a really good and dependable machine.  Rock solid!  My issue is it doesn't have enough umph for 1080p MKV videos - which is my primary source of entertainment now for the family.  It's beyond what most people use their laptops for.  

Plus, tax write-offs.  :)

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@ Eric A. Duncan

Thanks for this amazing post.  I'm another satisfied customer after completing all the upgrades:

CPU - I upgraded to the Intel 7200 and followed your cooling scheme... idle temps dropped from 55 to 34C!  I had idle temps as low as 28C before upgrading the GPU.  My fans rarely kick on and usually only in low speed.

GPU - I'm running windows XP 32 bit and had problems finding the correct driver.  After much trial and error, version 257.21 fixed artifacts, flickers, and occasional BSOD.  For awhile, I thought I had a bad 2nd hand card, but it was just the driver.  Here is the link for those who are still using XP 32 bit:
http://forums.laptopvideo2go.com/topic/26923-v25721-windows-xp-32bit-nvidia-desktop/

Memory - This was an easy upgrade... I wish I had known years ago that the e1705 could handle 4 GB (3.25 actual).

Hard Disk - I upgraded about 6 months ago to 320GB, enough to hold my data libraries.

@BlacRayne00 and potential upgraders:
New machine versus upgrade?  Good question.  I've tinkered with computers since the 1970's and at one time or another used almost every brand and OS from Commodore 64, Apple ][, PCs, Macs, and Unix.  I've found that there are three reasons to change hardware: 
1.  Performance - hardware is not fast enough
2.  Reliability - crashes and failures = lost data
3.  Compatibility - can't run software or can't communicate with others

Eric's CPU, memory, GPU and HD upgrades focus on the first item: Performance.  After the dozens of machines that I've used over the decades, I've found that the best combo is a more current machine running older software.  I'm currently using 2006 hardware (perhaps 2007 with e1705 upgrades) with 2001-2005 vintage software.  If I upgraded to 2010 software, such as Adobe CS5 suites, I'm certain that I would be unhappy with the e1705 performance.  So, ask yourself, do you REALLY need the latest version of software to do your work (or play a game)?  Personally, I'm very pleased with its new performance after the upgrade.

The second item: Reliability.  I've also found that the e1705 to be "Rock Solid" (quoting Eric) and one of the most reliable laptops that I've ever used.  I've also owned bad machines (such as the Powerbook 190CS) and data loss means wasted time... my time.  I've only had a handful of freezes with the e1705 over the years, but for the most part, it's been a very faithful PC.

Finally:  Compatibility is always the driving force for me to upgrade.  Running common software at work, home, and school, is an important consideration if you are sharing files with others.  Nothing worse than to try to open a PowerPoint file at an executive presentation and not have the fonts display properly due to OS/version differences (been there!)  Compatibility also implies that you can run the software that you want to run on your PC.  If I can't run a CAD or statistics program for my work, then it's time to consider options.

Upgrading the e1705 is about $350.  Switching to a new PC is not just the cost of a new PC, but also upgrading software, potentially replacing peripherals, and time spent tweaking the OS and preferences.  If I upgraded to a new OS 7, 64 bit laptop, the cost would be in the thousands to buy new hardware and upgrading to 64 bit software.  

It took me about 3-4 hours to complete the upgrade, including applying AS5 and finding the correct driver.  Overall, it was a straight forward process and I want to thank Eric (and other contributors on the this post)for the simple directions.

I'm glad that I added a few more years of life to my E1705.  Someday I'll need to buy a new PC (or Mac) but for now I have a great PC that just works.  It's fast, reliable, and runs the software to get the job done (or play Starcraft II)

Very interesting class-action lawsuit!  That seems to be the very issue most of us experience after the upgrade!  

Problem is, none of our systems qualify if it had the ATI x1400 128/256 (like I did).  I went through pretty much all of it, and saw where the lawsuit only affects those that had an nVidia chip before the upgrade.  If any ofyou did, and you had "issues", it sounds like you can qualify.

Good find man.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I think that the legal case may have some merit based on my experience.

I had my NVidia Go 7900 GS card completely fail for no apparent reason in my e1705 a little after a year of use in 2007... a few months after the warranty expired.  I ordered a new one from Dell and replaced it for the steep cost of $400 at the time.  BTW, Dell was charging $1100 in 2007 for a Go 7900 GTX, refurbished!

It seems that I'll qualify based on the settlement website.  I even have the original receipt for the replacement card.  I might even have the dead NVidia card in a junk box somewhere.  I kept the receipt only because the replacement card was "refurbished" by Dell.

Hopefully, I'll be reimbursed and this will completely pay for my recent CPU, GPU, Memory, and HD upgrades.  I won't hold my breath since it seems that the legal fees are high and the reimbursements might not cover the entire cost.  Who knows how the judge will rule too.

I’m never this fortunate to have kept a receipt for three years.  Hopefully my nVidia FX2500 card that I just installed won’t crap out.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[A word of caution for those who have made the video upgrade to the nVidia fx2500m card.  Be extra careful not to run a graphics intense program while using battery power and not on AC.  The card will fail in the blink of an eye and be PERMANENTLY DAMAGED.

I use my laptop for engineering CAD as well as games.  While away from desk and running on battery, I opened a CAD drawing which had auto-rendering turned on.  The software immediately attempted to complete the render and froze.  I couldn't reboot the PC and had the black screen of death.  I tried to fix it by reinstalling the card, but eventually I decided it was a lost cause and bought a new card.

Unfortunately, this happened TWICE to me.  The first time I thought I had a faulty video card, not realizing that a file was saved with rendering on.  The second time I figured it out.

It's a very expensive mistake to under-power your the Nvidia GPU.  The OEM batteries supply 90 Watts max and 130 watts is needed to run safely.

I realize that most of you would never encounter this, but I just wanted to pass on what happens when you engage the card without the 130 watt ac adapter.

I need to be able to view CAD files while mobile, so I had to revert back to my OEM Nvidia 7900 gs.  I miss the GPU power of the FX2500m already.

Well, i did buy an external 1Tera drive, got the one with a plug since i wanted 7200 RPMs to put some games on it and other time wasting stuff.

But i regret this so much, as i travel allot for work it is so annoying to have more stuff to carry, more wires and stuff to put somewhere on desk..

If i would have made the smart decision of buying a internal drive i, well i would stay this way, but i could  get rid of the dvd and put a SSD in that space. But i want more than the 80 gigs i have now, 100 gigs does not seem enough, i would surely settle for 300 or so..

But anyways that is why i am looking for another rotating plate drive for now and for a few bucks more the hybrid seemed as nice nice solution to speed up boot and 'regular' software (mail, web browser, instant messaging and such..)

Long reply!
I guess no one here has tried those new hybrid drives..

@Geby
I have the PA15 too no problem for your laptop!
(i do work in electrical engineering and i can tell you that the 19V is always supplied as a stable power supply, but the amps number you see is only the maximal current the unit may supply, it will provide whatever the laptop draws up to its limit where these units usually overheat and shut down, which you probably know since you bought a more powerful power supply!)]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Jacob: Go to http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/ for your drivers.

Yes, a complete uninstall of software and drivers is always recommended.  One way to ensure that is to go into Device Manager, find the old device, right click it and select uninstall.  It should prompt you with a screen, and at the bottom it will have something like "Also uninstall any software" associated with that driver.  Can't remember the exact wording.

As for gaming, pretty much all games play well on it - except those with monster graphics, like Crysis: Crysis doesn't run well even on latest SLI setups and you have tone things down.

I'd start with medium graphics on everything and find a way to monitor FPS of the games (I use my old FRAPS app that I love). Then slowly increase everything.  My target is usually 60 FPS or higher on games, since the LCD is 60 hz.

Things will "game better" on the 1400x900 display because it is smaller than the 1920x1200 upgrade (which will stress your card more).  I kind of wish I had the 1400x900 now, as I run my Win7 on my Inspiron at 150% larger-than-normal font.  Maybe I am getting old, but 1920x1200 resolution on a 17" screen is pretty freakin tiny.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Wow, lots of replies in a short time!  Sorry guys, was travelling for a bit.

@Jacob: Yeah, it's a little confusing to find the right driver.  All "drivers" posted on laptopvideo2go are straight from NVidia's website.  The issue is Nvidia's drivers doesn't support laptops as-is (for the most part), and doesn't support these cards directly - when in fact the drivers actually do.  They claim a "please see your laptop maker for correct drivers", which is usually the same damn thing but with buggy Dell software added ontop.

So, here's the missing piece to those that are new to LaptopVideo2Go:

- Get the drivers from that website AND...
- Get the matching INF file for those drivers.

An "INF File" is a textfile that ends with .inf.  This file holds the key identifying information that links the drivers to a specific card.  E.g. the 7950 GTX from the hardware's embedded ID.

So, the procedure is:

- Unzip the drivers to a directory.
- Copy the INF file into that directory, and overwrite the existing INF file.

This is because the INF file that comes with Nvidia's drivers do not support the 79XX series mobile video cards.  The INF you are copying has been modified to support it (and all other nvidia laptop cards).  

Why doesn't LaptopVideo2Go just package up the correct INF file in a single download so you don't have to "find the right one and copy it"?  Because of Nvidia's license for the drivers that allows you to distribute copies - but it cannot be modified.  That's how LV2G gets around the license (they had legal issues before, and Nvidia sent them a "letter").

There's just 1 catch (always a catch right?).  For some unknown reason, LV2G posts the latest Nvidia drivers almost immediately.  But, the INF file isn't modified fast enough.  Usually takes a few more weeks.  Therefore, if you attempt to download the "Latest Drivers", most likely the INF file is missing.

Solution?  Just download a driver 2 years old or newer - nothing has changed for the 79xx series driver in over two years.  lol.  You don't need the absolute latest.  Just backup a few versions and pick one that has the matching INF:

You may even try the INF enhancer, at your own risk (seems to fix a "When no video is available" tweak, may be worth looking into!):

@Paul: As far as I remember, you cannot install the drivers without the card present.  It will say soemthing like "An NVidia card is required."  But that's just memory, I could be wrong.  It will NOT hurt anything to install them ahead of time.

Also, having multiple drivers installed should be fine.  I was running 2 ATI cards and 1 NVidia card, switched out an ATI card for a different NVidia, and then switched all 3 cards for two new Nvidia cards - all without removing or installing different drivers (ATI and NVidia drivers for newest cards work across them all).  This was on my desktop, that I am typing this very post on (1.5 year old install of Win7, need to format it to 'clean it up').]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Geby: Sorry, but I'm not understanding.  Are you trying to play the game Battlefield 2 at a resolution of 1920x1200, and you are looking for my FPS of 89 FPS?  :)

If memory serves me, I averaged about 50 to 70 FPS playing BF2.  I peaked around 95 FPS, and that screenshot at the top was at 89 FPS.

You have slightly better hardware than me (I have the fx2500, you got the fx3500).  

I am not sure if you are talking about BF2, or other games.  Newer games, like Call of Duty Black Ops, maybe issues running at full resolution and everything on High.  My desktop has 2x Nvidia 470 GTX killer cards in SLI - and Black Ops only hits about 120 FPS with everything turned up on 1920x1200 (my desktop monitors are the same resolution as the inspiron).  A single 470 card only hit 60 to 70 FPS.  It's also a very overlocked i7 at 3.8 Ghz.  So, in comparing the desktop to the laptop, yeah Black Ops won't run very well.

So let me know what game you are talking about.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Update.

I've gotten my computer running again! After my last post last night, I thought about what happened EVERY TIME I dropped the old card back in and booted up...I had to reset the date and time because I kept unplugging the tiny battery connected to the mobo. So, I reset the date/time, turned the comp back off, dropped in the fx2500 WITHOUT unplugging the tiny battery, and rebooted. Worked like a charm! Went straight to windows login and then installed the drivers.

I will admit, I'm not seeing a lot of performance increases. I'm wondering if it is because of the driver or my settings. I'm about to run WoW to see how it plays. Anyway, maybe my experience can help someone else.

Thanks again Eric!]]></content>

I visited this site last june, when my graphic Nvidia 7900 failed, and was anly possible to use it as VGA.
It was a known problem, for which Nvidia payed Dell $200 millions, but Dell refused to refound me!

I bought on ebay an un-spcified ndivia board, that, after installation, revealed as the Quadro fx 1600.

And after this pc revived it returned me to this page, showing me the same adjustment work I just did!

I have a Dell 9400 ispiron who has a broken video card, can I put another card with a low power, such as from the ispiron 9300,9200,9100.
I don't want a powerful card with more memory, 
I just want the video to work.
If anyone has tried or knows let me give advice.
I would be very grateful to everyone who help me.

I would look for an ATI 1400, as they are cheap and usually these guys are playing it with the higher end cards.  Just a tip, make sure to get one with 256 MB of ram, in order to run Vista/7 with the GUI enhancements.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Alex: Yes, the 7900 series is a step up from the 7800.  About a 10% increase in GPU.

You'll also grealy benefit by upgrading to the T7200+ series CPUs as they have double the L2 cache - which is the single biggest gain you can do with a CPU.

http://ark.intel.com/Compare.aspx?ids=27255,27233,

The T7200 is the minimal you want as that had 4 MB of L2 cache, anything lower only has 2 MB.  There's also the T7400 and T7600, if you can afford it.  

Yes, go for 4 GB of ram by getting two of those sticks you linked to.  If you plan on playing any game within the last 4 years, you'll need it (e.g. BF2 uses about 1.6 GB of ram on my laptop, the OS uses about 800 MB + other apps).

Wow, get that BIOS updated already!  A01?  Hehe.  Always run the latest BIOS.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Alex: Well, it does take a hardware fimilar hand.  If you've never done a PC either, then perhaps ask around for a PC guru in the family or alike.  Even though there has been a few that posted on this article that this upgrade was their first venture into a PC themselves and they seemed to do ok.  The main issue is hte ribbon cable, you have to be very precise - it isn't hard, just some people short-cut it and it won't work.

This is Dell's Service Manaual for opening the laptop and doing these things.

http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/manuals?c=us&cs=28&l=en&s=dfb&redirect=1

My article here is just a helper to clarify some parts the service manual was not clear on - such as the plastic hinge cover in my pictures above (scroll up).  I give a few tips on how to remove that, when you think you may be breaking it.

Also, there seems to be a lto of T7600 cpus on ebay: 

http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&_nkw=T7600+&_sacat=See-All-Categories

Refurbished means very little warranty - if you wait too long to install it, you can't return it.  Then again, that's the chance we all take with eBay anyhow.

Good luck!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Alex: Well, it has "better" support for OPen GL rendering in Windows, if that is what you mean.  The FX series just means it has extra instruction sets for the GPU for things like CAD and architectural designs.  The FX series uses the same 7800/79XX GPUs.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Quadro#Quadro_FX_M

The only cards you are interested in are:

Quadro FX2500m = 7900 GTX (which I have pictured above)
Quadro FX3500m = 7950 GTX w/faster clock speeds

Even though that wiki page lists them at 256 MB, they are availabe in 512MB versions - and that's what I have in the pictures above: Quadro FX2500M w/512 MB of ram.

There are non-Quadro cards with the 7900 and 7950 GTX GPUs, but honestly they seem to be rare and I cannot advise anything on them.  ]]></content>

I finally ordered a  Quadro FX2500m/7900 GTX the only prob i am having is figuring out what driver i need i noticed in earlier posts that there were some links to another page where i could not figure out which one to download. the card is currently working with the old driver, but i would like it to be 100% also i noticed that a lot of people are running either vista or 7 i plan to keep xp if that has any affect on the driver selection. thanks again for all of this info first time i worked on my computer = winning]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Mikey: congrats on the your first bust-a-pc-open!  Yeah, always a bit confusing to get the latest driver.  Here's the XP 32 bit one:

http://www.laptopvideo2go.com/drivers/xp/267.59/disclaimer

The way it works is:

1) Download the drivers (first link at the bottom) and run it to extract the files to a directory on your computer.

2) Download the INF file (the 2nd link at the bottom), which is a single little txt file.  Copy this file into the same directory that you extracted all files to in #1 above.  It will ask you to overwrite the existing INF file, say YES.

3) Run the setup.exe in #1 like normal.

Enjoy.

To all others, never click the link at the top-right of laptopvideo2go.  It's just the latest drop from Nvidia.

Instead, you always want to click the "Drivers" link a the top and get 1 or 2 versions older.  The reason being is the INF usually isn't available for the absolutely latest driver files.  So, backup a month or two.

In reality, you can back up 2 or 3 years just about and get the driver.  Nothing has really changed with the 7XXX series.  It's the 8XXX series Nvidia cards that has changed drivers over hte last year or two (3D compatible).  And no, the 8000 series do not fit/work in our laptops.  ]]></content>

I have purchased an e1705 on ebay. Owner said the motherboard was bad. I tried it when it was delivered. Lightds blinked for 30 seconds and then it shutdown. I purchased another motherboard, same part number. I install the same ram that was in the origional motherboard. It still did not work. I then Install another 512 stick of ram I had out of my 9400. It booted fine. I then bought two 2 GB sticks of ram from Kingston same as I have in my 9400. Installed and still no luck getting it to boot. Went back to the 1 gb stick and it booted fine. Both my 9400 and E1705 are running A10 bios. What could be the differance in the two machines. Same part numbers on motherboards.

Do the Kinston ram sticks work in your working 9400?  

Also, I believe there is a DIMM A and DIMM B and A has to be populated before B.

THat's about all I can think of.  Or, the mobo is not as tolerate due to an older/newer revision.  Revision of motherboards can change the internal parts of the system.

Thanks for the response.
RAM is Kingston HyperX Performance, Mobile Memory #KHX5300S2LLK2/4G    1.8v
wWhen the RAM would not work in the E1705 I swaped them for the ones in my 9400. Works and is not a problem.
Also when I was trying to troubleshoot hardware, when I first received the E1705 I switched the cpu and video displays and there was no problems.
In fact worked so well I never swaped back. Do any settings in the bios make a differance? Right now I have 1GB in DIMM A. When I put anything in DIMM B laptop will not boot.]]></content>

My T7600 finally arrived and I've put it in with ease despite my newbiness! 
Now, I'm wondering about overclocking, what type of benefits will overclocking present to gaming? I also used produce music with a desktop of mine and it worked wonderfully, from this laptop... not so much, it takes up A LOT of CPU to do generate music. 
I have not tried this new processor out yet with music, but I am still wondering if overclocking would bring any benefit to either of these aspects that I use my computer for, gaming and music production?

Also, the Quadro FX... my buddy keeps calling me absolutely insane/stupid for wanting to get one because I read it here on your guide. He says, "it is a workstation card, not a gaming card, they are meant for OpenGL and not DX. An absolute waste of my money."
What type of improvement am I looking at over my Nvidia GeForce 7800Go? ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Alex: Congrats!

Well first, you can't overclock the CPU.  A few people are flashing the bios of the GPU cards and getting a tad more out of them (I didn't, and still going strong to this day).

As for Quadro FX verses anything is first, all Quadro cards are a 79XX series card.  Here's Wikipedia's link for comparison (grab a cup of tea and sit back for a while):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Nvidia_graphics_processing_units

What you'll notice is the Quadro FX 1500M/2500M/3500M all have the same processor and specs, and all come with 512 MB of ram. These are extremely common in the XPS version of the 1705, hence why we are purchasing them here.

The problem with selecting a GeForce 7 Go Series mobile card is a lot of them are just 256 MB in size.

Tell your friend that the Quadro FX X500M series GPUs is the same GPU as the Series 79XX GeForce Go GPUs.  The difference is the Quadro has additional instruction sets for CAD rendering.  It's like comparing a Pentium to a Xeon processors back in the day - they were the same chip, just the Xeon has additional instruction sets that could be taken advantage of in server environments.

If you can find a GeForce Go 7900 or 7950, make sure it is:

* GTX
* 512 MB of ram

Stay away from the 7800 series you listed, they are slower and are all only 256 MB of ram.

The screenshot at the first of the article is on my Quadro FX 2500M card, which is a GeForce 7900 GTX 512MB card.  I got 90 FPS, and mostly around 50 FPS.  So, I can't complain for gaming speeds.  :)

But note, the 7900 GTX is also available in 256 MB: you don't want that.  So, if you find an FX, you know it's 512 MB. If it's just a 7900 GTX, you have to look carefully for 512 MB.]]></content>

Good work on this page. I have already found I have come back for reference several times.

My laptop already had most of the upgrades you mention, but I wanted to have ago at the graphics. Currently I have the ATI x1400.

I got hold of a fx2500 and rather sadly had the black screen issue. I have returnbed the card and intend to get another or a fx3500.

Are you aware of any mobo/GPU revision incompatability issues I should be aware of or do the black screen issues just seem to be faulty cards?]]></content>

@Bill: I'd say to remove one of the sticks and boot with just 1 in teh system.  I think you not have one of the sticks properly mounted.

Also, the system will only show 3.2 GB with two sticks installed.

Finally, my advise in these comments is to stick to the 32-bit version of Windows 7.  The 64bit only gains you about 100 MB of ram.  But the extra memory taken up by the 64-bit is more than that so you end up loosing the small gain.]]></content>

Have the same problem with nVidia Quadro FX1500M.
It has only 1 heatpipe but those which I can find on Ebay have 2 as yours 2500M.
Are these heatsinks interchangeable that I could just replace just GPU itself? If it worked since 2006 with 1 heatpipe it should last for a decade more with 1 so I will not need to crash the body alloy. What you'd say? Thanks in advance.]]></content>

The heatsinks should be interchangable as the board is what changes.  I "believe" so, yes, though I never disassembled it.

Cool article man. I've been having some problems with the amount of GHz my computer is running on. I have the same one that you showed in this how-to and I was wondering if this new gaming card increased the amount of GHz that your computer ran or runs on. Also I am wondering if you recommend overclocking up to 20% with no extra cooling systems or other hardware added on.

That is ground I have never marched on, so I'd say you'd have to search elsewhere for that more about overclocking the graphics card.  The CPU and memory cannot be overclocked.

As for the amount of "Ghz", could you clarify what device you are talking about?  CPU or GPU?  As for the GPU, yes it is clocked higher than the ATI X1400 that came with the system.  ]]></content>

Ever since then I have been saving and purchasing parts along and along. (realized I needed a different mobo near the end...) I finally have it all put together and PFFFFT. Nothing. Just the scroll lock and caps lock lights blinking and the NUM lock and power lights steady. Nothing on the screen. I have read most all the comments. (lol no easy task) and am grateful for all your tech support! What do you think is wrong? I checked the video cable and its secured, mobo COULD be bad I guess, I can hear the HHD spool up and then stop. Then after about 20 sec all the lights go off... Is it a bad card? Its a 7950GTX all the other parts (- the mobo) where pulled from my working E1705... Any help is appreciated. Thanks again,

Good to hear people are still tinkering with these things, though the parts are becoming hard to find now.

You said "scroll lock and caps lock lights blinking".  That would indicate to me a bad motherboard itself.  If you attempted to boot the machine without a video card in it, it would beep an error code.  So since you aren't hearing that, and see these lights blink, I would point to the motherboard itself.

Could be that a wire is missing, or a cable not secured.  ]]></content>

@Phuc: I don't know.  This original post was about the E1750.  The Dell M90 is the precision version of the E1705, which actually had a slightly different case to accomidate these FX2500 and FX3500 we talk about here.  

I don't know if the BIOS will support the FX2700, as the bios in the E1705 would not support the FX2600 properly.  And the M90 was out about the same time as the E1705.  It would be a far reach to see if it would support the FX2600.  But the FX2700, that's a big big bet.

Also, the heatpipes are complete different between the HP and Dell.  

Be good to know if it would though.  Good luck!]]></content>

I couldn't find a direct reference for "GeForce 8400M GS" on Wikipedia's page:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Quadro

To answer your own question, you would need to search for the 8400M to see if it uses the same form factor, and heat pipes in Dell machines, as the FX1600M/FX3600M.  I'm guessing 1600M and 3600M because the 7000 series went with 1500M/2500M/3500M designations.

But, all may be for nothing because the FX1600M and FX3600M cards, while do fit and does work in this E1705 laptop, the backlight control does not.  Therefore, you'd be permanently stuck with a very dim and unusable display.

So, in my quick opinion, I'd say it would not be worth it.]]></content>

Last week, My wifes laptop ( a 9400 one ) began to show screen atrifacts as soon as it is booted up on Dell logo, with blue screen during windows boot procedure and the possibiity to boot only to safe mode. Using your guide, I was able to open completely the laptop. I cleaned every fan and heat dissipator, but the problems still occur. I noticed that the GPU fan ( the right one on the pictures ) seems to be dead and it's not turning any more. I managed to order a new one to replace it.
But if my GPU was damaged by the heat, what would you recommand me to get the best performance in 'old' 3D games such as Bad Company of Left4Dead ? This laptop is running a 64bit seven windows with an SSD that already gave him a second birth.
A few more words to thank you so much for this guide wich is so usefull and complete and to apologize for my poor 'french-english'.

Sadly, the GPUs for these laptops are near impossible to find now.  The ones out there now are pretty much all bad/not working and people have returned them, only to be listed on eBay again.

As for Bad Company/Left4Dead, those actually require a GPU with a bit more horsepower than the 7000 series has.  Well, if you turn all graphics down to lowest then it may play decently.

But if you can find one, and want to take the chance, the FX2500M that I used in this guide has been pretty good.  Just be warned that it only supports DirectX 9.0, which limits you to newer games that requires DX 10 and/or DX11.  Also, I had to stop using my machine because my development software only supported DX10.

Lastly, you can try the good ol' Oven Trick to get it working again:

Yes, that is the perfect card that everyone wants for the E1705!  if you can get it, do it.  But, the ones here in the states usually don't work any more.  

So, make sure the seller has a great return policy and accepts refunds for when a product doesn't work (and they have great feedback).  That way, you can get it, try it, and the most you will loose is shipping fees - which I'd be willing to gamble to get that card.

If the ebay seller does not have a return policy, or they have bad feedback from people trying to return things, don't get it.

The only issue with this install is that the screen brightness remains very dim. It seems to be a bios issue because it does not recognize the video card and the screen inverter remains on the lowest brightness setting.

The way around this for many was to connect an external monitor. Otherwise besides that issue it seems to be the most powerful GPU able to operate on these notebooks.

Can you share any clever ideas as to how we could possibly combat this brightness issue without having to utilize another screen.

I use mine as a small portable media center, and sometimes Linux for Android development.  But that's about it.

There's no real solution I'm afraid because I believe the pins have been changed.]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Getting GoDaddy SSLs working in Firefox on IIS]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>Upon installing your SSL certificate purchased through GoDaddy, and your Firefox users get prompted with a certificate warning of "Unauthorized Authority", read on for a fix using Windows 2003 Server (and R2).&nbsp; This also works for any other authority that is not authorized by default in any browser.&nbsp; In this article, I provide links to GoDaddy's Intermediate Certificates.&nbsp; If you obtained your SSL certificate through another party, ask them for their "Intermediate Certificates" to download for IIS.</P>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P><A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer" target=_blank mce_href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">SSL certificates</A> are commonly known to secure a channel of communications, such as the web and email.&nbsp; The problem when installing GoDaddy SSL certificates on a server is Firefox may prompt you stating that the certificate is from an "Unauthorized Authority".&nbsp; </P>
<P>Why is GoDaddy an unauthorized authority on SSL certificates?&nbsp; <A href="http://bloggit.livejournal.com/26595.html" target=_blank mce_href="http://bloggit.livejournal.com/26595.html">Bloggit</A> has a good definition over on his blog, as well as a resolution for <A href="http://www.stunnel.org/" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</A> and apache systems.&nbsp; But, we are using IIS so things change a bit for us.&nbsp; The bottom-line is a simple quote from his blog post:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>In practice, while </EM><A href="http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/" mce_href="http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/"><EM>Opera</EM></A><EM> and </EM><A href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm" mce_href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05649a.htm"><EM>Internet Explorer</EM></A><EM> come [installed] knowing about GoDaddy [as an authorized authority], Firefox and Thunderbird do not. And therefore presumably several other devices also don't. They gripe that GoDaddy is an "Unknown Authority"... rather than silently accepting it.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To better describe what is happening, think of how an SSL certificate gets authorized by your browser.&nbsp; I am going to take a stab on how I think it works (feel free to correct me in the comments).&nbsp; The browser receives the header information for the SSL certificate upon the first communication to the web server.&nbsp; Within the header of this request is the complete information and public key of the SSL certificate information.&nbsp; But also included in the SSL certificate header information is the reference chain of the issuer, which is GoDaddy (or whomever issued your SSL certificate).&nbsp; If the client's browser does not have GoDaddy listed as a known and authorized issuer of SSL certificates (i.e. Firefox and Thunderbird do not, but IE7 does), the browser will prompt the user of the Unknown Authority.&nbsp; So the fix is to add a known issuer of SSL certificates that is "linked" to GoDaddy's (better known as Intermediate Certificates) at the server level.&nbsp; </P>
<H3>Resolution</H3>
<P>The fix is to get GoDaddy added to the list of companies that are authorized to issue SSL certificate.&nbsp; And, this is performed on the web server serving up your custom SSL certificate.&nbsp; We will need to add the GoDaddy company to the reference chain of authorized issuers of SSL certificates.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Basically we want to say, "GoDaddy is known as a child of the bigger company Starfield".&nbsp; Starfield is GoDaddy's parent company and is in Firefox and Thunderbird's list of authorized authorities.&nbsp; </P>
<P>And just like SSL certificates that must be issued by GoDaddy to be authorized, Starfield must issue a similar certificate that describes GoDaddy as a known authorized authority of SSL certificates.</P>
<P>I am going to list the steps first outlined by <A href="http://www.alagad.com/go/blog-entry/getting-rid-of-web-site-certified-by-an-unknown-authority-messages" target=_blank mce_href="http://www.alagad.com/go/blog-entry/getting-rid-of-web-site-certified-by-an-unknown-authority-messages">Doug Hughes</A>, with some modifications and pictures.&nbsp; Below are the set of instructions to get your new GoDaddy SSL certificate installed first.&nbsp; We will tackle the Starfield GoDaddy Intermediate Certificate later.</P>
<OL>
<LI>Copy your GoDaddy certificate into a file named domainname.cer on your web server.&nbsp; The name is arbitrary, but let it end in .cer for simplicity.<BR></LI>
<LI>Click Start -&gt; Run and type <FONT face=System>mmc</FONT> and press Enter.&nbsp; This opens the Microsoft Management Console.<BR></LI>
<LI>Click File -&gt; Add Remove Snap-In.&nbsp; <BR></LI>
<LI>Click Add to open the Add Standalone Snap-In Window<BR></LI>
<LI>Scroll to find the <FONT face=System>Certificates</FONT> snap-in as shown below.&nbsp; Select it and click Add.<BR><BR><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" border=0 alt=step5 src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step5.jpg" width=702 height=492 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step5.jpg"> <BR></LI>
<LI>In the corresponding wizard, select <FONT face=System>Computer account</FONT> and click Next.<BR><BR><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" border=0 alt=step6 src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step6.jpg" width=700 height=492 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step6.jpg"> <BR></LI>
<LI>Select <FONT face=System>Local computer</FONT> and click Finish.<BR><BR><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" border=0 alt=step7 src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step7.jpg" width=699 height=492 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step7.jpg"> <BR></LI>
<LI>Click Close and then Ok.&nbsp; Now you will see the <FONT face=System>Certificates</FONT> snap-in in the MMC.<BR></LI>
<LI>Expand the <FONT face=System>Certificates</FONT> node, right-click on <FONT face=System>Trusted Root Certification Authorities</FONT> and select <FONT face=System>All Tasks -&gt; Import</FONT> as shown below.<BR><BR><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" border=0 alt=step9 src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step9.jpg" width=700 height=490 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step9.jpg"> <BR></LI>
<LI>Click Next and then select the domainname.cer you created in step 1 above.<BR></LI>
<LI>The next step in the wizard should indicate that the certificates will be placed in the <FONT face=System>Trusted Root Certification Authorities</FONT>.&nbsp; If it does not, you will need to select it by clicking Browse...&nbsp; Once it looks like the below, click Next.<BR><BR><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" border=0 alt=step11 src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step11.jpg" width=700 height=490 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step11.jpg"> <BR></LI>
<LI>Click Finish on the final page.&nbsp; You should be prompted with a dialog that states the import was successful.<BR></LI>
<LI>Finally, you will need to stop and restart the website that the SSL certificate belongs to for the changes to take affect.</LI></OL>
<P mce_keep="true">&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Final Procedure to install the Intermediate Certificate authority</H3>
<P>Unfortunately, you are not done.&nbsp; The above only installs the GoDaddy certificate in the root trusted root certificates.&nbsp; The client's browser will not authorize it just yet.&nbsp; To finish the process, you will need to install GoDaddy's Starfield version of their Intermediate Certificate.&nbsp; Here is the all important link to go download it:</P>
<P><A title=https://certs.godaddy.com/Repository.go href="https://certs.godaddy.com/Repository.go" mce_href="https://certs.godaddy.com/Repository.go">https://certs.godaddy.com/Repository.go</A></P>
<P>If you obtained your SSL certificate through another party, such as the discounted VeriSign type, you will need to obtain the Intermediate Certificate from your provider.&nbsp; But the steps are identical to resolve.</P>
<P>There are a number of certificates available in the link above.&nbsp; So for simplicity, I downloaded the bundled package that includes all of them named <FONT face=System>Go Daddy PKCS7 Certificate Intermediates Bundle (for Windows IIS)</FONT>.</P>
<P>Note: Take a special notice that this will download a file with the extension of .p7b.</P>
<P>The final step is to get the bundle of certificates installed.&nbsp; You do this by following exactly the steps I outlined above, 1 through 13 all over again.&nbsp; Except on step 10, you will need to filter the Files of type drop-down as shown below.</P>
<P>Note: You only need to perform this process once per server, as it will be installed at the root level of all certificates for the server.&nbsp; So any further GoDaddy SSL certificates installed will pickup the Starfield SSL certificate as the parent company of GoDaddy.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Step 10 change:</P>
<P><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" border=0 alt=step10 src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step10.jpg" width=703 height=550 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/GettingGoDaddySSLsworkinginFirefox_13F76/step10.jpg"> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will now let you browse to the gd_iis_intermediates.p7b file you downloaded from GoDaddy.&nbsp; Follow the rest of the steps exactly.</P>
<H3>Final thoughts</H3>
<P>That is it.&nbsp; Make sure to stop and restart the web site that your new SSL is to take effect on.&nbsp; Or you can do an IISRESET to force an update to all websites.</P>]]></content>

So I will not bore you with any (except I am really liking&nbsp;the isolated tabs, besides the alpha issues).&nbsp;But, as I am doing Google Chrome testing today I noticed something interesting on how Google Chrome handles popups.&nbsp;Check out the video I recorded today.</P>
<P>Interesting how Google does not block the popup.&nbsp; But instead, they&nbsp;animate the window by moving it down and across the bottom of the screen!</P>
<P>I have not isolated the exact reason to why&nbsp;as Chrome does not&nbsp;move other window.open popups such as Facebook's Share on YouTube.&nbsp; But the one fact I have found is the Facebook Connect uses XSS (cross-site scripting) which we have had to configure to allow them to run scripts.&nbsp; If someone wants to test it on other sites that are using XSS, please let me know your results.&nbsp; The Facebook development team was also able to reproduce it, which removes my machine as a possible source (or virus).</P>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[The truth about 802.11n, 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/Thetruthabout802.11n5Ghzvs2.4Ghz_8309/wirelessnetworkingtips1.jpg" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/Thetruthabout802.11n5Ghzvs2.4Ghz_8309/wirelessnetworkingtips1.jpg"><img style="border-right-width: 0px;

or even &quot;B&quot; setup.&#160; The odds are you are not getting a 5Ghz device, even though you see “Dual Band” and 802.11N plastered all over the box.&#160; So let me take a few minutes to explain the truth behind all of this Wireless 802.11n buzz and why most consumers are not exactly getting what they paid for; but, with a little careful planning ahead of time and some special configurations you can make the most out of the hardware you acquired.&#160; I apologize for sitting on this knowledge for years and not blogging about it earlier, so let me make the wait worth while.</p>  <h2>802.11n Dual Radio</h2>  <p>For those that want and answer right away, you will want to invest $200 into a “Dual Radio” 802.11n router and not a “Dual Band”.&#160; Dual Radio means your router can operate up, away from the interference, in the 5.8Ghz frequency.&#160; There are dozens of “dual band” 802.11n routers out there, but only a select few of dual radio.</p>  <h2>What is the truth behind 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz, besides radio bands?</h2>  <p>To quickly sum up, this 802.11b/g 2.4Ghz frequency is flooded from all sorts of cordless device.&#160; From microwaves to cordless phones.&#160; But note that 802.11a over 5.8ghz was golden from day one without any of this fuss.&#160; Now that I have teased you with the interference and bands, let us drive into why all of this matters with 802.11n.</p>  <p>With the mass proliferation of consumer electronics (cordless phones, remote control devices, etc), the FCC approved the radio frequency of 2.4Ghz for up to 1000Mbps to be opened up to consumer-grade electronics in the 90s, across a wide range of bandwidths.&#160; I followed the <strong>HomeRF Working Group</strong> talks (now disbanded though) when they were creating the specifications for home networking across a local area network (LAN), wirelessly, in the 90s.&#160; Their standard basically outlined a &quot;Frequency Hopping&quot; protocol that would allow a device to operate on multiple channels, similar to how cordless phones work and how they can &quot;change channels&quot; when there is interference.&#160; They were responsible for your 802.11b (2.4Ghz) and 802.11a (5Ghz) standards.</p>  <p>In September 2000 the FCC ruled to approve HomeRF requests to increase the bandwidth of 802.11b devices over the 2.4Ghz RF band spectrum to 5Mhz, but with a very limited number of 15 channels and only a maximum of 11Mbps.&#160; I believe the FCC did this because of Bluetooth's (and many other company's) arguments that allowing 802.11b devices to utilize a higher bandwidth would cause massive interference amongst other consumer devices.&#160; </p>  <h2>802.11a/b/g/n differences</h2>  <p>Here is a quick summery of the history of the IEEE 802.11 standards we have had available at this point.&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>802.11b - Rated at 11mbps over a 2.4Ghz frequency for the 1Mhz and 5Mhz spectrums, it was the first widely adopted standard. </li>    <li>802.11a - The need for more speed drove the 802.11a standard at the much higher 5.8Ghz frequency.&#160; </li>    <li>802.11g - The one we mostly know these days operating in the 2.4Ghz frequency with additional channels over 802.11b. </li>    <li>802.11n - Operates at both 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz.&#160; <em><strong>The new Draft 2.0 forced operation at 2.4Ghz by 'default'.&#160; More on this later.</strong></em> </li> </ul>  <p>Note that there an 802.11y specification floating around which operates at 3.7Ghz.&#160; The advantage of this specification is its massive range - over 5000 Meters (about 3 miles!).&#160; You may hear more about this later on in the news.</p>  <h2>Why you should care about 802.11-<em>whatever</em> and their differences.</h2>  <p>You see, we have had the technology for 802.11n for a while with 802.11a.&#160; Why did it not succeed?&#160; The 802.11b devices at 2.4Ghz were massively produced, and were cheap. 802.11a devices, while about the same price, operated only at 5.8Ghz and came to the market too late because everyone else had 802.11b in their laptops, homes, and offices.&#160; If you had an &quot;A&quot;, you couldn't connect to &quot;B&quot;.&#160; And vice versa.&#160; This is why &quot;A&quot; died out, even though it was a better technology.</p>  <p>The 802.11g 2.4Ghz standard in 2003 fixed the interference issues with more channels, hoping to get out of the range of other consumer electronics while staying in the cheaper-to-produce-products 2.4Ghz range.&#160; But sadly this is not the case any longer since 1000s of wireless devices now use this “wide open” 2.4Ghz frequency and 1 Mhz and 5 Mhz spectrums.</p>  <p>The 802.11n specification had a great opportunity to fix this interference by going up to 5.8Ghz, once and for all.&#160; All the while allowing for backwards compatibility, which is important for products to succeed.&#160; In a way they did, but for double the cost.</p>  <h2>The reason you get low signals with &quot;G&quot; and now &quot;N&quot; these days.</h2>  <p>Note that if you live out in open rural or large lands, you will not see the problems.&#160; But the vast majority of us have a neighbor within 100 feet of our home (or dozens in an urban environment).</p>  <p>With population comes more wifi devices.&#160; Since there are only 11 channels available in “G”, and there are dozens of wifi devices near you, how much will you bet that there will be a high level of interferance?&#160; A lot as it turns out.</p>  <p>I myself had to deal with this recently with our loft in downtown Dallas.&#160; Opening a wifi scanner, I saw 31 wireless networks, and I could hardly ever use 802.11g in my open home.&#160; Asking the neighbors, they all had issues “getting a router that works, they are all junk.”&#160; Well, it wasn’t the router.&#160; But instead, just the large number of wireless networks near by.</p>  <p>Once I upgraded to the Linksys WRT600N (with dual radios), I was solid! </p>  <h2>Dual Radios vs Dual Channel vs Dual Mode vs Dual Band vs MIMO (The Marketing buzz-words)</h2>  <p>Finally, the nit-n-gritty of this post.&#160; I will say it loud and clear: </p>  <blockquote>   <p><em><strong>Stay away from dual channel devices and only get a two radio device!</strong></em></p> </blockquote>  <p>What is dual-two-huh?&#160; It is simple: To operate a device at a frequency of, say, 2.4Ghz, you need a RF radio to broadcast and receive at that frequency.&#160; To operate at 5.8Ghz, you need a RF radio as well.&#160; To operate at both frequencies (sometimes called Dual Channel or Dual Mode), your radio switches from 2.4Ghz to 5Ghz.&#160; But the limiting factor here is a RF radio can only operate in one mode or the other.&#160; Not both at the same time.&#160; These dual channel/dual mode devices have a history of “cutting out” when mixed G and N devices are connected.&#160; It is better to operate them at 2.4Ghz at all times.</p>  <p>How do you operate at both channels?&#160; Simple, you have two radios: one at 2.4Ghz and the other at 5.8Ghz.</p>  <p>The biggest buzz is that 802.11n specifications allow it to operate at either 2.4Ghz or 5.8Ghz.&#160; This allows you to run at 2.4Ghz and connect all of your 802.11g devices as well as 802.11n devices.&#160; </p>  <h2>Why do I need to operate at both channels or even 2.4Ghz?&#160; Can't I just use 5.8Ghz?</h2>  <p>Good question and this is where a little preparation of selecting the right devices comes into play.&#160; If your home has all 802.11n devices (laptops, Xbox/PS3 wifi adapters, desktop, friends and family visiting over Christmas, etc), then yes you can get one of the cheaper 802.11n routers with &quot;Dual Channels&quot; and setup your 802.11n network for strict 5.8Ghz mode.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, most homes will need 802.11g backwards compatibility.&#160; Your son's friend might stop by with his 802.11g laptop.&#160; Xbox only has an 802.11g wifi adapter (that I know of).&#160; And 100s of other reasons of why you still need 802.11g backwards compatibility.</p>  <p>These cheap &quot;dual mode&quot; or &quot;dual channel&quot; 802.11n devices is what will hurt you.&#160; You will be forced to operate at only the 2.4Ghz band for 802.11n to allow other 802.11g devices to connect, which opens you up to interference from all other consumer electronics on your area.</p>  <h2>And now why you want to pay the extra $80 for a dual radio 802.11n device.</h2>  <p>It allows you to connect your laptops and other devices at 802.11a/n over one radio configured at 5.8Ghz, while supplying the 802.11g/n channel over the more interference-prone 2.4Ghz radio.&#160; That is it.&#160; It simply isolates you at one radio.&#160; This allows your visitors to connect at 2.4Ghz, given not a stable connection in urban America but better than nothing.</p>  <h2>The downside to 5.8Ghz, objects.</h2>  <p>There is always a catch, right?&#160; The 5.8Ghz range of 802.11a and 802.11n are more susceptible to solid devices (i.e. walls, floors, etc).&#160; Even though the 802.11a/n standard allows for further range, the 5.8Ghz frequency is quickly blocked by solid objects, severely cutting down your range.&#160; </p>  <p>As a comparison, take a loud car stereo.&#160; The bass blasting from a neighbor’s car stereo next door, or in the car next to you.&#160; How come you hear the thump thump thump of the subwoofer, but you do not hear the 500W he is pushing to his vocals through your windows or walls (or, they are severely muffled)?&#160; Simple, the sound waves of low frequencies are much longer/further apart and usually carry more power.&#160; This allows for the sound wave to move through solid devices, where higher frequencies are blocked because of the very short and quick sound waves and lower power.&#160; Same applies to the 5.8Ghz range of 802.11a and 802.11n devices.</p>  <p>If you have a 3 level home (like we do), placing the 5.8Ghz device on the middle floor is usually best.&#160; But, could still cause problems just a short distance away, on another floor.&#160; This is where 2.4Ghz might actually be your best bet in your house.</p>  <h2>Optimizing your 802.11n Router</h2>  <p>For those that remain with the dual-band router, or decide that 2.4 Ghz is the best choice due to interference of objects, or want to tweak that 2.4 Ghz channel, you can make sure to optimize the settings to get the most out of the router - as most router's defaults are &quot;fail safe&quot;, and not optimum.</p>  <p>802.11n includes a protocol for &quot;Wide&quot; channels.&#160; The default freq and speed for 802.11n is 20 Mhz and 130 Mbps.&#160; While a major increase over the previous 54 Mbps cap of 802.11g, it's only half of what the router can actually do.&#160; Switching to &quot;40 Mhz&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;Wide Channel&quot;, you double your speeds up to around 270 Mbps.</p>  <p>There's a catch though.&#160; Bluetooth devices usually operate in the 40 Mhz range of the 2.4 Ghz channel as it really is an unlicensed data range - this is why a lot of devices clash when you get &quot;out of spec.&quot;</p>  <p>So, in short, if you don't have any bluetooth devices, then set it to 40 Mhz and be happy.&#160; Your older 802.11g devices should still work as well.&#160; But, to each his own - it may take testing that Xbox or other wifi devices to make sure they can still connect at the older 20 Mhz freq when you have set 40 Mhz (the protocol allows for backwards compatibility).</p>  <h2>802.11n 5.8 Ghz Summary</h2>  <p>In closing, the FCC did a bad thing when it opened 2.4Ghz 1Mhz and 5Mhz spectrums to consumer devices – besides just routers.&#160; This has caused great interference and frustration of thousands of people world wide (cause most of the world adopted the same standards).&#160; So our beloved 802.11g routers are now being lost in the noise, literally!&#160; </p>  <p>So, look for those 802.11a/n/g dual-<strong>radio</strong> devices, and not a dual-band, dual-channel, dual-mode.&#160; </p>  <p>Personally, I run my 2.4 Ghz and 5.8 Ghz radios at 40 Mhz and with different SSIDs (the wifi &quot;name&quot; or identifier), so I know which one I am connected to.&#160; I also have a separate 802.11g device to power those older wifi devices on a 3rd SSID (good ol' Linksys WRT54G running the <a href="http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato" target="_blank">Tomato</a> firmware) .</p>  <p>Please leave feedback about any issues or questions.</p>]]></content>

Dual channel device
1) Use 2.4GHz or 5GHz, but not both simultaneously

Dual radio devices
2) Use 2.4GHz and 5GHz simultaneously

So the point with your recommendation 2) is that you can use both channels simultaneously? Is that so? So the Linksys WRT610N is dual radio device?

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Kebabbert: Yes, Exactly!  The WRT610N is a perfect choice (and my preference when I need to buy another one).  When Cisco bought-out Linksys, they discontinued my WRT600N.  Actually, they killed the entire product line using that hardware.  Finally, Cisco saw the QA issues at Linksys and decided to outsource all of the routers to a different supplier - which now gives you the WRT310N (a dual-channel device) and the WRT610N (a dual-radio device).

Also, I recommend operating the WRT610N on two different SSIDs: one for your 2.4Ghz devices, and one for your 5.8Ghz instead of mixing.  When you mix, you leave it up to your wifi card's drivers to decide on what frequency to use and what channel.  I'd rather have faith knowing exactly which freq. I was connected to, especially when in line-of-sight of the 5.8Ghz device, or if I am on a different floor/room.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Mauricio: I hear your concerns.  A lot of users expect too much out of the WRT610N, that it will be the answer to their prayers.  

As mentioned in the post above, 802.11n over 5.8Ghz is horrible with lots of solid objects (walls, multiple floors, etc).

Also, I have noticed that a lot of users tend to set both radios to the same SSID.  This is bad, as the default for 802.11n is to default to the 2.4Ghz radio - therefore not getting the benefits of the 5.8Ghz clearer range.  I'll update my post to reflect that little tid bit, or make another post about optimizing your dual-radio router.  But more or less, suffix the 5.8Ghz radio's SSID with something like (5Ghz).  Makes it easy to know which is which that you are connected to as well.

Those are the two biggest issues users face, and have complained about, and most do not know how to configure around those issues (for example, don't waste money on a dual-radio if you going to placing it two floors up, or at the far edge of the house of where you will be working at the other end).  

I also read deep dive reviews where they tore apart the WRT600N and WRT610N to compare them inside and out, as well as free air tests of both radios.  The WRT610N scores quite high, if not the highest, out of the dual-radio routers on the market as of this posting.]]></content>

I have only been able to achieve these 270 Mbps connections by setting the radios to a "Wide Channel" though.  Leaving them on Auto doesn't seem to give me more than 130 Mbps.  ]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is a great write-up on the various 802.11 standards.  But I would recommend the following.

1) Single channel 5Ghz 802.11n router if you don't need 2.4Ghz support and have problems streaming HD video or accessing/copying large files via PC to PC using LAN wifi.
2) Single channel 2.4Ghz 802.11a/b/g/n router if your dwelling has 3+ floors or lots of walls to go through.

A 2.4Ghz router will work in an urban setting but requires that you have a router that gives a strong signal and is confiured correctly (requires features that not all routers have).  The 802.11n standard is still "draft" and for that reason I really can't see people investing the money for 5Ghz routers unless they have problems obtaining top speeds (mainy for HD streaming and large file PC to PC wifi copying/access).  Otherwise a good 802.11a/b/g/n 2.4Ghz router should handle all that anyone needs.  The router I would recommend for people to get is the D-Link DIR-655.  But spend some time configuring it so you get the max. out of it.]]></content>

Yes, for lots of walls/floors, that's where the 2.4Ghz has an advantage.  But if you live, say, in Brooklyn where your neighbors are within 20', putting multiple 5.8Ghz is your best bet to have the cleanest signal across multiple floors.

As for the D-Link you mentioned, I do NOT recommend that model.  It's only a single radio device, which my post above shows you why that's a bad idea in conjested neighborhoods/dwellings.  You can only obtain 2.4Ghz freq, never a single 5.8Ghz connection.]]></content>

I've been seeing a growing trend that client wireless cards in laptops and minis are only 2.4 Ghz.  That kind of sucks.  I would investigate into what kind of wireless card you have in your computers to see if it supprots 5.4Ghz.

Other than that, try updating firmware - of both the router and the wireless card (you can get firmward by finding the maker of your wireless card).

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I have been searching for a couple of weeks to find an article like this. Thank you.
There are still a couple of things that are unclear to me. I have an ADSL modem that operates my wireless network at 802.11g. My PS3 and Wii are also 802.11g (I have not seen any 802.11n adapters for them), so I am stuck using 802.11g/2.4GHz for the foreseeable future. 
I have to upgrade my laptop, so I would like to ensure it has a 802.11n wireless adapter, and then get a 802.11n router to connect to my ADSL modem.
In my circumstances, I "think" I just need a 802.11n router operating at 5.8GHz. Then I effectively have two radios. I do not need dual band/dual mode/dual anything. 
Does that sound right to you?

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Jeff:  Dammit.  And I tried so hard to target SEO keywords.  Just curious, did you find this through Google or Bing?  Bing seems to respond better to abstract keywords.

Yes, that sounds right - continue to use the ADSL Router/Modem combo for your 802.11g devices.  And you can use the 5.8 Ghz range for your laptop.  Just be aware of the interference from walls and floors (solid objects).  

Most laptops these have 802.11n, but I've started to notice newer 802.11n cards that do NOT connect at 5.8 Ghz - they are only 2.4 Ghz.  This is very sad, as it is very difficult to know if a wireless card that has 802.11n will connect to both radios now.  In the past, they all worked fine on either radio.  But this more recent findings that some cards do not do 5.8 Ghz kind of sucks.

Tip: you get lag over wireless for gaming.  Consider running an RJ45 to the TV area, and use a "Gigabit Switch" to connect your PS3 and Wii.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Thanks for the quick reply. I looked for this information through Google. I thought I had tried every search combination over the past couple of weeks, but something in the search I chose (now forgotten, but I think it had 802.11n and 2.4GHz in it) finally connected me with your site.
As for your comment on network adapters, quite right. It seems as if the default wireless adapter for a lot of laptops with 802.11n adapters is just 2.4GHz, and you have to do some digging to find that out.
A tip I read elsewhere said that if the adapter is described as b/g/n rather than a/b/g/n (or something else with an "a" in it), it will only connect at 2.4GHz. Only adapters that includee the magic "a" will connect at 5.8GHz (or so I have read).
As for running an RJ45, why would I bother? If I am only getting 6-7MB/s through my Internet ADSL, I am already well under the 50-ish MB/s I get with 802.11g. The reason I want the 802.11n connection is to increase the speed when accessing from a network attached drive (yet another thing I am trying to research, if you have any advice!)]]></content>

The RJ45 (or cat5) cable was recommended to get lower response times, besides bandwidth.  You are correct, you won't get any more speed - but your latency will drop from 400ms or so to around 50ms - far better for online gaming or "lag".]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Jim: That's simply not true at all.  I've setup Public (no encryption) networks that connected at 270Mpbs (270Mbps is the max btw, not 300Mbps - kind of like how 1 MB really equals 1024 KB).

It all comes down to rather both the router and the card support the "wide" channels.  Which are the "40 Mhz" channels, which are NOT enabled by default.

Another thing I have found out, especially with Dell laptops, is the Dell drivers only connect at 54 Mbps no matter what.  I have 3 laptops!  And on each and every one of them, the Dell drivers only connect at 54 Mbps.  I have to delete the driver (and check the box to make sure it deletes the software), then let WIndows find the card itself and install it's own Microsoft version.  Then I get 270 Mbps.  I know, I just did it again the other day when I formatted a laptop (last week actually).]]></content>

"Simultaneous Dual Band" is not what I recommend, as it means just a single radio.  THis post outlines the needs for dual-radio devices, not single-radio.  

For example, LinkSys "dual radio" devices start in the 500 number series.  Anything lower is just a single radio, like the WRT400N. (Which is advertised as "Simultaneous Dual Band.")]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Amazing post, Eric. Still the best guide I could find in 2011!

I just wanted to mention that there is a cheap option for those not willing to splurge on a dual-radio device (they are still quite expensive).  The idea is, if you have an old 802.11g router that you plan to replace, DON'T THROW IT AWAY.  Instead, use it for your 2.4Ghz devices, and restrict the 802.11n router to the 5.8Ghz spectrum.  The trick is to make the old router an "access point" and hook it up as a client of the new router. This way, everybody is on the same network. 

My setup at home is as follows:

- Linksys WRT310N (dual-band capable, but single-radio) in 5ghz-only mode, 40 MHz width.  This is in default mode in terms of the router table.  It dishes out IP addresses by DHCP as usual.  The WAN port is hooked up to m cable modem.  SSID=FastHookup

- Belkin 802.11g router (old!).  This is in "Access Point" mode which means the DHCP server is disabled. Be sure to give it a static IP address, and configure the encryption + SSID *before* you turn on Access Point mode, or you won't see it on your network. The WAN port of the old router is hooked up to any of the 4 INTRAnet (LAN) ports of the new router.  It is basically a slave, dishing out 2.4Ghz WiFi, but nothing else. SSID=SlowHookup (NOTE:  this is not the same as the SSID above!)

One less box in the landfill, and I saved $80.  Good luck all!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Fisslefink: I completely agree!  Keep the old router and use it as a repeater or another branch of the same network.

And you did it correctly by making two different SSIDs, so they show up differently in the house.

I personally use my trusty old WRT54G router that I have running Tomato's firmware (http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato).  It's verys imilar to DD-WRT, just much more user friendly.  

Also, Tomato has better QoS features than DD-WRT.  So, I actually use the WRT54G router as my "internet router" - the gateway to my internet provider.  The only trouble with that is it is only 100 Mbps.  While I have 50 Mbps down right now through Verizon FiOS (love it!), another provider locally is offering 100 Mbps down - and the WRT54G wouldn't be up for that task.  But for right now, it's just fine.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Trailrunner: Sounds like an advanced setup.  The good news is you have the perfect pieces to do just that!

Your Linksys WRT45G has been hacked to run many different, and powerful, versions of firmware.  I myself use my old WRT54G v3.3 at the head of my network, connected to my FiOS connection.

When you get a dual radio version, you just want to connect it behind your existing WRT54G - using both routers.  That keeps your newer dual radio isolated from the older WRT54G network you setup.  All on different SSIDs.

If you load one specific firmware, called DD-WRT (www.dd-wrt.org), you have even more options.  DD-WRT supports "Virtual VLANs" for each network.  You can setup all 3 "isolated" subnets as you want using a single router with DD-WRT installed on it.  And, DD-WRT was first created to support the WRT54G - so it's 100% supported, fyi.

Just, that configuration of isolated subnets can be a bitch.  You'll have to do a lot of editing to the firewall and route tables (it's Linux afterall).  If you are comfortable going that far, then DD-WRT sounds like a winner for you.

If that sounds too much, then stick to the simple WRT54G as your head-router/gateway, let their friend's connect to that 802.11g SSID, and use your new dual radio router behind it for your personal stuff.  

The catch there is, the packets can still be  sniffed.  So if your kids have some shady hacker friends, then switch routers - put the dual-radio as your head device connected to the cable modem, and connect the old WRT54G WAN to router, and let their friends connect to the WRT54G.  That completely isolates the subnets, going through two NATs and all.

Just remember, set different SSIDs and make sure the channels are set not to overlap.  

Good one!]]></content>

You want your visitors to use the WRT54G, since it only does 802.11g.  You want to reserve the newer router for your stuff.  Don't worry about seperating the Xbox from your stuff - unless you have 50 or 60 client computers, nothing is going to affect that in speed.  You'll be fine.

Just sounds like you want to isolate your visitors to use a protected subnet, which would be the WRT54G connected to your new router, while the new router is connected to the cable modem.

There are other options to.   LIke using a dual radio router on multiple subnets with DD-WRT and alike.  That's all beyond what I can help you with here.  

THe forums at DD-WRT.org would be the source for VLans on the WRT54G and/or new router with DD-WRT loaded on it, and isolating the packets between them.

Just saying, the easiest thing to do would be to connect the new router to the cable modem, and the WRT54G to it - and setup the WRT54G for the visitors.]]></content>

Good question.  I would try to use 802.11n over 5.8 Ghz first, as it has a wider range of channels.  802.11a is 10 year old technology, and also limited in speed.

Just make sure the wifi cards you get for the laptops/desktops "support" 802.11a <- the "a" being important as it indicates the card supports 5.8 Ghz.  Without the 'a', most likely the card only supports 2.4 Ghz.  

As mentioned in the comments, there is an increasing number of cards that only support 2.4 Ghz.  The way to identify these inferior cards is to look for the "a" in the 802.11 a/b/g/n specification.  If it says 802.11 b/g/n, skip it and fine one with 'a'.

Good luck!]]></content>

Like everyone else it took me a while to find you, and your information is priceless. You answer many questions my Router/repeater/extender folks couldn't, and the reason I have so much money invested and still have poor results for the dollars.

Thank you for taking the time to post this valuable information.

My problem is getting quality, uninterrupted signal throughout my 3 story home.

I live in a neighborhood where I can see 18 SSID's on my laptop signal bars as well as when I program my wireless bridges. Based on what you wrote I have a lot of "Noise" & interference. I know now that's the problem because the signals from my repeater drop during peak hours, early morning and late afternoon.

My DSL modem and new wireless router are on the bottom floor. My repeater is located on the second floor, and my laptop, and wireless bridge that supplies the signal for the FTA receiver for my TV ( I live in Mexico) is on the top floor.I have a wireless bridge on all 3 floors for the receivers.

I'm 70 years old and retired of course, and TV is important, sports for me and soap operas for the wife. I'd like a recommendation of which 5.8 freq. systems I need to purchase to get me up and running without outside interference,i.e. Router, repeater. My wifi bridges are Vonets.

Once again thank you for the informative article.

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Loboron:

Why thank you very much for the compliments!  I wish you had left an email address, to reply directly.  But here's to hoping you come back to see my reply...

18 SSIDs is a bit cluttered.  The 3 story house makes it even more complicated.  

You are doing exactly right by having multiple devices, one on each floor.  I am assuming you have set them up properly on the "same" SSID, but "different" channels, correct?  If they all shared the same channel, then that would be a problem.

How are the repeaters connected?  Are they being used to extend the existing wireless signal?  Or, are they connected via RJ45 (cable) to a common switch somewhere in the house?

I ask because extending a wireless signal like that across multiple floors works best over 2.4 Ghz, not 5.8 Ghz.  Which, it sounds like you are setup for (since u are asking for 5.8).

My advice would be to hardwire each repeater with RJ45 to a common switch in the house.  Trying to extend a signal of a signal of a signal won't give the best results.

Another thing to be concerned with is frequency hopping: having the devices on different channels but the same SSID.  While this is the preferred method for your setup, it can cause issues with streaming devices: like your "FTA receiver" or any device that wants to tream.  Frequency hopping easily breaks the connection and rejoins on a different channel, but same SSID.  

I would advice on a single dedicated 5.8 Ghz router on the same floor as your streaming device: e.g. TV, and connect it to that on a different SSID, isolated from your existing network.  

As far as which 5.8 Ghz device to get, I don't know... My 5 year old WRT600N is going strong.  Some others have purchased the WRT610N/E3000 and had great success (dual radio device).  All of those are N/A at this point.  The E4200 seems to be what replaced the E3000.  The main difference that I can find is the CPU in the E3000 controls the 5.8Ghz radio (the 2.4 Ghz radio is merged in).  While the E4200's CPU controls the 2.4 Ghz band, and the 5.8 Ghz is merged in.  This means better 2.4 Ghz performance being native to the CPU, but sub-par 5.8 Ghz performance.  In other words, the old WRT600 and WRT610/E3000 routers (same device) seem to be king still.

Good luck on your adventure!  I'd concentrate on running cables to each floor.]]></content>

Thank you for the extended reply and information. Want a job?

Albeit running wires to each unit would be ideal, it's also impossible here without spending many $$$. As I mentioned earlier, I live in Mexico, my home's outside walls are block and all the rooms are aluminum framed. This is why I have so much wireless to get from room to room.

Here's my current setup, perhaps it will give you a better picture and you could offer some modifications to improve it.

Bottom floor:

Location of ISP modem ( which is the only area available)and is hard wired to my wireless router.

Second Floor:

Location of the wireless Dual radio repeater which is hard wired to an FTA receiver.

Third floor:

Location of my laptop and another FTA receiver with Vonet wireless bridge, both receiving the signal from the repeater on the second floor.

The two main issues I have is, #1. the repeater often drops the signal from the router. The router is no more than 30 feet and almost in line of sight from the repeater. No obstructions. It will work great for a day or two and then no sending signal registered on the repeater.It will show receiving the signal from the router all the time. I unplug the repeater for a few seconds and it will work again for a day or so, then I have to repeat the process again.

#2. When the repeater is working OK and I have the signal on the third floor, the wireless bridge will show the signal strength at 80% one day and the next it will be at 30% and of course my laptop and FTA receiver drop off line as the signal is to weak.

There's never a physical change, e.g. doors closing, or new obstructions. I'm told it's interference from neighbors as this occurs mainly during afternoon/evening hours?? Very frustrating.

With regards to channels, my ISP modem and wireless router are on different channels, 6 & 11 respectfully. The repeater can't be programed, it scans, however the bridge reads it as being on channel #1 or #2 when I check it.

The SSID's are all stock names, Router 150N and the repeater is Smart repeater.

Thank you again for your time and patience.

Ron

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Loboron: It sounds like you have everything pretty much covered.  On different channels, dual radio repeater, etc.  Yes, at busy times there are more wifi signals and causes the signal strength to lower.

It doesn't sound like much you can to improve things over what you got.  Except maybe replacing all devices with 5.8 Ghz units, but that is $$$ and not guaranteed to work with the metal contruction you have.  Even though, things could still drop.

Try going down to the 2.4 Ghz range for everything, and move the repeater to the 3rd floor to directly connect to the other devices.  E.g. skipping the 2nd floor.  

Your FTA receiver will be just fine without it for a few days (just uses it for channel lookups, right?).

At this point, it's just experimenting.  The 5.8 Ghz band may not be best for you with the multi-level home and metal constructions.  Try things out at 2.4 Ghz.

As for reliability in your kind of setup, unless you go with a commercial units, I doubt any repeater/bridge combo is going to work without issues.  It really may be time to run those cables along the floors.

Well, another option is to try Ethernet Over power.  They plug into your power outlets, but allows you to transmit ethernet (network) over your power lines to another room.

I have no idea what a/c outlets Mexico uses though.]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Dan: I removed your email address, to help with spam.  I'll also be sending this comment via email as well.

I hate to be the one to break it to you, but that SRP541W is just a glorified router, an upgrade over the previous Linksys 4400 business series.  Cisco makes such a huge profit off these.  Now, it does have larger buffers for I/O, which means they can go much longer between "resets" and actually stream data without hitting that limit, to multiple clients.  THat's a good thing with FIVE daughters!

That router does not have a broadcom CPU, and therefore your options are limited on what firmware you can load - to only Cisco's firmware.  

And, as long as you agree to be spied upon, you can continue using that router:

http://boingboing.net/2012/07/03/cisco-locks-customers-out-of-t.html

With all of that said, it boils down to you are limited to whatever Cisco provides in their firmware.  I do not know that router very well, so I hate to say it, but I would recommend contacting Cisco directly for what you are allowed to do (they usually try to sell you on something bigger and more expensive when getting into what you are trying).  Say no, and just ask if you can connect the Repeaters to this device.

I would also direct you to more experienced gurus over at WirelessForums for that specific question: 

http://www.wirelessforums.org/

Just FYI: For my repeaters, I usually run custom firmware (like DD-WRT) that allows me to reconfigure the router as a "Bridge", or even a "Repeater" and Bridge all in one (using different ANTs).

Next time, you may want to steer clear of Cisco and go for something like these:

http://www.dd-wrt.com/shop/catalog/index.php?cPath=ccc_6

Though, they do require some technical knowledge.

Good luck!]]></content>

Looking to transmit A/V via Teradek's CUBE series which operate over wifi at 2.4 & 5.8GHz.  
We are wanting to send A/V signal to our video switcher (Tricaster) for football games.  We do not want to drag around CAT 5 cables all over the field - so we are hoping for the best using the CUBES. 
It is a small town football stadium with no buildings nearby other than the stands the people sit in and the booth that sits behind and above everyone.  It's in the booth where we will have our wireless router and switcher. (We could also hang a antenna outside on top the booth.)
There will be all kinds of cell phone activity in the stands I'm sure. But we will have a clear line of sight to the cameras and their transmitters (wifi) so I'm hoping this will be ok. 

In your opinion should we leave our routers set to 5.8GHz or not?
Would a external direction antenna with extra gain help much?
We are looking to push 2.5Mb to 5Md/sec data rate (depending on if we use 1 or 2 cameras with their transmitters).
There won't be any internet hookup to the routers - just the A/V signal.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated - and Thank You!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[@Terry: Yep, I get direct emails for every comment.  Though, sometimes I am travelling and can't get to it for a few days.

First, that is some high-end hardware you are mentioning.  So you are a bit out of my league for the tiny devices us other minions can only afford and all I have played with personally.  With that said, there are a number of good assumptions we can make here.

As far as wireless communications, yes the 802.11n standard allows for up to 270 Mbps, which allowing for some error correction, yields about 20 to 25 MB/s under what I would consider optimum conditions.

A football field is big.  The range of 5.8 Ghz is about the same as 2.4 Ghz.  It all centers on the amount of power the devices use.  Those devices you mentioned I am sure are pushing the FCC limits of the allowed wattage.  ;)

Directional ANTs are a big plus with wireless too and I've some success with them (basketball court), especially if you have line of sight.

And considering people like to use bluetooth headsets now with mobile devices, that's the reason to stay away from 2.4 Ghz.

I would hate to advise you on purchasing several of those equipment, only to have them not transmit reliably.  Then again, those are what the professionals use.  Having a direct line of sight, with directional ANTs, and at 5.8 Ghz gives you your best chance for success, yes.  If it was me, I'd go with the setup you are thinking about, but place some high-powered bridges around the lower stands, like 1 in each corner of the field (3 or 4 total) and use CAT5e just to those bridges.  That would save you from having to string CAT5 all throughout the stands. 

Good luck!  And come back to let me know how it worked out.]]></content>

One could argue that the power is the same, just that there is more noise from the other devices that are transmitting, making it more difficult to get a strong lock on the device.

@Danny: You've done your homework, and you are exactly right that I didn't mention the 20 Mhz band vs 40 Mhz band trick to get around some of the neighbors (I found this out recently myself).

As for microwave oven, it all depends on exactly what microwave transmitter they have.

Lastly, about these cheap dual RADIO routers: they are so cheap now!  Here's the current list and what I pick them up for on eBay:

Cisco WRT610N V2 ONLY = $35 <- highly preferred, cheap, and V2 version is 450 Mhz!  V1 has several issues using 3rd party firmware, like DD-WRT, with the 5 Ghz radio.

Cisco E3000 = $45 <- Exactly the same WRT610N above, right down to the same broadcom CPU chip and motherboard.  Absolutely no different!  Just a rebranded WRT610N V2 when Cisco wanted to get away from the old Linksys naming convention.  Though, there are newer versions with faster CPUs.

Cisco E4200 V1 ONLY = $75 <- You got to be very careful with this E4200.  Version 1.0 is what you want, as it uses a broadcom CPU.  Version 2.0 or higher is a totally different animal, and does not support any 3rd party firmwares!

Because of how cheap I found the WRT610N V2s going for on eBay, I snatched up 3 myself!  I now have 3 WRT610Ns in my home, throughout multiple locations, setup properly over the 1, 6 and 9 channels to share the same SSID.  Flawless internet, and damn my neighbors!

I was shocked when I found out that my wife's iPhone 4S was only 2.4 Ghz.  That is only device in our entire house that doesn't have a 5.8 Ghz radio!  

If you are asking if you need a dual radio device to allow your laptop to get the speed, the answer is yes if most of your devices are sharing the 2.4 Ghz, then it is simple to deduct that a single device on 5.8 Ghz will enjoy full bandwidth to and from the wifi AP since no other devices is sharing the bandwidth.

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P><A href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/7StepstoSEOQuickly_14B2E/willseoforfood.jpg" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/7StepstoSEOQuickly_14B2E/willseoforfood.jpg"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 20px 10px 0px; DISPLAY: inline; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" title=will-seo-for-food border=0 alt=will-seo-for-food align=left src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/7StepstoSEOQuickly_14B2E/willseoforfood_thumb.jpg" width=204 height=172 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/7StepstoSEOQuickly_14B2E/willseoforfood_thumb.jpg"></A> SEO stands for Search Engine Optimizations.&nbsp; It is a term used to reference a website’s HTML source code and related metadata and url for search engine rankings.&nbsp; I recently was involved with interviewing and working with a number of SEO firms here in New York City and picked up a number of quick tips that anyone fimilar with html and css can knock out.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I prefix this post that my own weblog can’t follow these rules 100% because of limitations with CommunityServer and how it bakes-in a number of HTML rendering elements that I have no control over – without editing the source code and deploying new assemblies – more than I care to do at this time.&nbsp; But, I have gotten it <EM>almost</EM> there.&nbsp; This is why I love ASP.NET MVC -&nbsp;full control over all markup even if it requires more UI work.</P>
<H2>H1 SEO</H2>
<P>These have the most impact on your blog’s ranking (at this time).&nbsp; The words you chose to insert into these, their repetition throughout the site (and what H* they fall into), and their correlation to your metadata on the page, and their position on your site all weigh heavily for ranking your site.</P>
<P>Several of these tips below center around the H1 and other H* tags and how to optimize them.</P>
<H2>1. The first rule about SEO Club is you talk about SEO Club, with H1 being first.</H2>
<P>Here’s a quick test.&nbsp; Open an article or weblog post on your site and go to File –&gt; Print Preview (or just print it).&nbsp; What is the first “text” you see at the very top?&nbsp; Is it the title of your post?&nbsp; If not, you fall down the list of rankings.&nbsp; Now, do the same here on my blog.&nbsp; Go to File –&gt; Print Preview and see what it looks like.&nbsp; You will notice it is the title of this page (8 steps to SEO Quickly), and then content after that.&nbsp; Nice and neat.&nbsp; Now, did you notice the header and navbar links are the very bottom?</P>
<P>This “print view” is pretty much what the search engine sees when it is trying to determine what text to index.&nbsp; If you have a large and complicated header, well your content – and H1 – get pushed way down the page.</P>
<P>To accomplish this takes a bit of CSS magic.&nbsp; First, wrap your header html in a div.&nbsp; </P><PRE><CODE>&lt;div id=”header”&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;</PRE></CODE>
<P>The next step is to wrap your content in another dedicated div.</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;div id=”content”&gt;…&lt;/div&gt;</PRE></CODE>
<P>Now, move the entire header div down below your content div.&nbsp; The final step is to use CSS to render a large “space” for your content div, allowing room for the header to be “positioned” to the top of the page.&nbsp; It should look something like this (using inline style definitions for easier reading).</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;html&gt;<BR>&lt;header&gt;<BR>  &lt;title&gt;My SEO post&lt;/title&gt;<BR>  &lt;style type=”text/css”&gt;<BR>    #content <BR>    { <BR>      margin-top: 100px;<BR>    }<BR>    #header <BR>    {<BR>      position: absolute;<BR>      top: 0; <BR>      left: 0;<BR>    }<BR>  &lt;/style&gt;<BR>&lt;/header&gt;<BR>&lt;body&gt;<BR>  &lt;div id=”content”&gt;<BR>    &lt;h1&gt;My SEO post&lt;/h1&gt;<BR>    &lt;p&gt;Search engines should love me now!&lt;/p&gt;<BR>  &lt;/div&gt;<BR>  &lt;div id=”header”&gt;<BR>    &lt;a href=”/”&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=”/about”&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;<BR></CODE><CODE>  &lt;/div&gt;<BR>&lt;/body&gt;<BR>&lt;/html&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P>Notice how the content html comes before the header html?&nbsp; And did you notice that the CSS styles will “push down” the content 100px, while absolute positioning the header above the content?&nbsp; This is the magic that is needed to “make the H1 the first text the search engine sees.”</P>
<H2>2. The second rule about SEO Club is you talk about SEO Club, with H1 being first.</H2>
<P>There is more to just moving the H1 up higher in your page.&nbsp; It must be the first text the engine sees!&nbsp; Some clients had difficulty with this because their H1 is buried down deep in a number of divs and sub-titles, tooltips, javascript inline, etc.&nbsp; </P>
<P>The general rule is, refactor your code so that the &lt;h1&gt; is immediately after the &lt;body&gt;.&nbsp; I know, this is near impossible.&nbsp; Especially with ASP.NET Forms’ inline javascript and script references just after the &lt;form&gt; tag.&nbsp; Also, you may want some “Recent Posts” or something above the &lt;h1&gt; location.</P>
<P>It basically boils down to, refactor your code to push the H1 as the first text.&nbsp; If you cannot, your fall down in rankings.&nbsp; Something so trivial, I know.&nbsp; But every SEO provider we looked into was hard pressed about this priority.&nbsp; So, I am stressing it here with you.</P>
<H2>3. Use all H1 through H6, on every page.</H2>
<P>Search engines love these “header” tags.&nbsp; They are perfect for pointing them to your relevant content.&nbsp; So, you should encapsulate as much text as possible with H tags.&nbsp; Just one sticky point, generally you should use all tags, but do not use the H1 tag more than once.&nbsp; Google will even give you errors for pages that use the same H1 title – it must be unique for each page of your entire site.</P>
<P>This is a bit difficult for me to follow in designing blogs.&nbsp; But, it can be done.&nbsp; Let me point you to a few ways you can use all H1 tags on your blog:</P>
<UL>
<LI>H1 for the Title of your blog post 
<LI>H2 for post headers/highlights.&nbsp; Like I am doing in this post, in bold. 
<LI>H3 for each Tag for your blog post 
<LI>H4 for sub-titles or sub-topics 
<LI>H5 for related posts 
<LI>H6 for each navbar element (i.e., mine are additional tags or group tags)</LI></UL>
<P>Yeah, a lot to break down for each post.&nbsp; But, every time you do will score higher with search engines.</P>
<H2>4. Concentrate on what content goes into those H tags.</H2>
<P>Now this is when you concentrate on what “term” you want to brand for your website.&nbsp; You really get only one shot at this, per search engine crawl.&nbsp; You can change it for the next time, but it will change your rankings.</P>
<P>Now is the time to pause and go use some of these SEO tools to find what phrase you can target.&nbsp; Look for something with a ranking that you can break into.&nbsp; Obviously, “Top Blog” is going to be out of touch for your small site, with 10,000+ links to some of the worlds top blogs.&nbsp; Instead, focus on something more tangible.&nbsp; Like, “Atlanta Bakery” or “NYC Wireless Cafe”.</P>
<P>The H1 on your homepage is the most important text on your entire site.&nbsp; Higher than metadata, higher than its content, and so on.&nbsp; This is your chance to focus on a word or phrase you want your users to search, and find you!&nbsp; So, insert your phrase you want to focus on for your site here in the H1, without variation, as is.&nbsp; You can also use little tricks with CSS to pull over something more meaningful to your users, while getting the H1 hit.</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;h1 class=”nolinebreak”&gt;NYC Wireless Cafe&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;span class=”h1-like”&gt;s in NoHo&lt;/span&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P>Let’s take my blog for example.&nbsp; I want to focus on “Eric Duncan” and I want people to search on that, and find me.&nbsp; Right now, I am battling an AAA baseball player for rankings on my name.&nbsp; Since Google ranks pages higher on links and ESPN and 100s of sites link to this baseball player, I am down to like 6 or 7.&nbsp; But on Bing, that looks at the actual content, I am number 2.&nbsp; Woot!&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now, technically you are to pick that one phrase, and implement it throughout your site with other H tags.&nbsp; For example, if I was hardcore I would want to update my tags to be H3 and worded something like:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Personal <STRONG>Duncan</STRONG> 
<LI><STRONG>Duncan’s</STRONG> Automotive 
<LI><STRONG>Eric</STRONG> on Geek Stuff</LI></UL>
<P>Or, going back to the wireless cafe above:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Cafe</STRONG> Drinks 
<LI><STRONG>NYC</STRONG> Favorites 
<LI><STRONG>Wireless</STRONG> Hours</LI></UL>
<P>Notice how I am working in parts of the target H1 in each tag?&nbsp; This is what gets ranked very very well.&nbsp; Before, the cafe would have had “Drinks – Favorites – Hours” as tags or navbar elements.&nbsp; But, by adding in parts of the target phrase for the H1 on the homepage, and making each navbar element an H tag, you now have much more ranking power.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Say if you have “Best” in your homepage H1, such as “Best NYC Cafe”, you would want to use “Best” in just about every H2 on&nbsp; your site going forward.&nbsp; “Best Dinners”, “Best Drinks”, “Best Menu”, etc.</P>
<H2>5. H1 –&gt; Title –&gt; Metadata –&gt; H2-H6 –&gt; url text</H2>
<P>That is the secret formula, that about 3/5ths of seo firms agreed on.&nbsp; Several of them gave variations.&nbsp; But more or less, that is what they say.</P>
<P>So, by those rankings, you should now focus on your &lt;title&gt; tag in the header.&nbsp; The rule is, the H1 should exactly match your Title.&nbsp; So, on your blog post page, your &lt;h1&gt; is the title of your post.&nbsp; Well, your &lt;title&gt; should exactly match that as well.&nbsp; It should NOT be prefixed with your site name.&nbsp; This is the mistake people tend to miss.&nbsp; “I want the site name in every &lt;title&gt;, so when it is bookmarked…”&nbsp; Well, that is the problem.&nbsp; If the H1 is different than your Title, then it isn’t a match.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Now some said you can suffix the title with your site’s short-name (just a little text).&nbsp; But there was debates to rather even this was acceptable.&nbsp; I would change my site here for it, but CS is limited in that regard.</P>
<P>Next is the Metadata.&nbsp; Yep, that thing that we were all taught back in the 90s was the “key” to searching.&nbsp; Well, it still is to a point.&nbsp; It can’t contain more than 10 keywords (or might get ignored completely).</P>
<H2>6. Friendly Urls or SEO Urls</H2>
<P>This is what a lot of people think gets ranked high.&nbsp; “Converting my post.aspx?PostID=523 to /archive/2009/09/20/my-cool-post/ is the best thing you can do!”&nbsp; Well, no.&nbsp; That is why it is #6.&nbsp; It is of a lower priority than the rest above, because as mentioned in #5, it goes H1 –&gt; Title –&gt; Metadata –&gt; H2-H6.&nbsp; And THEN it gets to Url.</P>
<P>And for those that don’t know, “SEO Friendly Urls” does not mean removing the querystring.&nbsp; Search engines are smart enough to analyze the querystrings and follow them.&nbsp; Google even found the ?p= and logged it as a “Page Index” variable on my site.&nbsp; </P>
<P>No, SEO Friend Urls mean removing the integer from the PostID= and making it something legible, and indexable.&nbsp; Like, the post title.&nbsp; </P>
<P>This works well for Wordpress blogs that want an SEO url, but does not have access to mod_rewrite.&nbsp; Just change the url to be http://domain.com/?p=%postname% and you should be SEO friendly going forward, without mod_rewrite.</P>
<H2>7. XHTML Compliancy</H2>
<P>It may seem frivolous, but search engines really are just computer programs with 100s of rules to follow when reading your page.&nbsp; One of those is it attempt to select these H* tags from your page and process them.&nbsp; If you have some funky text, broken html tags, and just general messy html, several of their rules will fail – and you fail to rank higher.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Go hit-up a validator to see how your site does: <A title=http://validator.w3.org/ href="http://validator.w3.org/" mce_href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</A></P>
<H2>8. Off-page SEO</H2>
<P>Everything else above covers what we call “on-page” SEO, which is the SEO you can control from your site’s markup.&nbsp; Off-page SEO is what Google’s entire ranking system is based on – <EM>how many websites link to your website</EM>.&nbsp; So, commission a dozen college students to go out and talk about your site on a few hundred websites to get those “off-page seo” links.&nbsp; Yeah, this is shady and is what causes those, “Oh man, cool post!&nbsp; Check out similar similar here at…” comments and forum posts you see.&nbsp; This is generating off-page SEO for those websites with spam comments.&nbsp; But, it’s what they do – and Google rewards them for it.</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>To sum things up, SEO is more than just a pretty url.&nbsp; It is about changing your markup and thinking before you do things.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Also, this is what the rules are as of 2009.&nbsp; In 1999, it was all about metadata.&nbsp; Who knows what it will be in 2019.&nbsp; Maybe it will be what images are being shown and how often you should images in each post (I get an image in each one for me).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Good luck!</P>]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Type Safety with ASP.NET MVC Futures]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I will show you how to strongly type some parts of MVC to get rid of those “magic strings.”&#160; I will also publish a few extension methods that expand upon this concept later on.&#160; So, this is a continuation of my <a href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/asp-net-mvc.aspx">Mvc series</a> that you can subscribe to.</p>  <h2>ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Futures</h2>  <p>You can download ASP.NET MVC 1.0 RTM from codeplex.&#160; You can even download the source code and step through what the framework is doing.&#160; What a lot of people overlook is an additional assembly available for download at these locations called ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Futures.&#160; You can download it from Codeplex from below:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=24471" target="_blank">Download ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Futures from CodePlex</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>This is a darling of an assembly using the namespace <strong>Microsoft.Web.Mvc</strong>.&#160; Usually these Microsoft “Futures” releases are developer code that did not get approved for RTM release.&#160; This assembly is no exception and includes a plethora of strongly typed extensions.&#160; The reason some of this code did not get approved was because some of it did not conform to Medium Trust requirements for the 1.0 release.&#160; So if you have a strict medium trust application, you may not be able to use the some of the code contained within the assembly.</p>  <p>I am not going to cover all of the extensions within this assembly.&#160; You can do that on your own with <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/index.htm" target="_blank">.NET Reflector</a>.&#160; Instead, I am going to cover just a couple that you will be using on a daily basis.</p>  <p>To get started, go ahead and added a reference to the Microsoft.Web.Mvc assembly to your project.&#160; In addition, to make things a lot easier, go ahead and add a few namespaces to your web.config.</p>  <pre><code>&lt;namespaces&gt;
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;System.Web.Mvc&quot;/&gt;  
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;System.Web.Mvc.Ajax&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;System.Web.Mvc.Html&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;System.Web.Routing&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;System.Linq&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;System.Collections.Generic&quot;/&gt; 

  &lt;add namespace=&quot;AspNetMvcTypeSafety.Controllers&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;AspNetMvcTypeSafety.Models&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;add namespace=&quot;Microsoft.Web.Mvc&quot;/&gt; &lt;!-- Add this assembly --&gt;  
&lt;/namespaces&gt;</code><p></p></pre>

<p>Hit CTRL-SHIFT-B to do a quick compile of your code (so the assembly is copied to your /bin). ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Futures is now available for your project.&#160; You’ll also note that I add my controllers and models’ namespaces.&#160; This is because you want them available from your views and controllers.</p>

<h2>Strong Typed Html ActionLink&lt;TController&gt;</h2>

<p>If you are already coding in ASP.NET MVC, you are using strings to reference controllers, actions, and views.&#160; An example to access to the MostRecent() action on a PostController would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%-- // Old way--%&gt; <br />&lt;%= Html.ActionLink(Model.DisplayName, &quot;MostRecent&quot;, new { Controller=&quot;Post&quot; }) %&gt;<br /></code></pre>

<p>You have to create an anonymous type and reference a controller with “Post”, for the action method “MostRecent”.&#160; Using the Futures assembly, you’ll see a few new extension overloads for Html.ActionLink:</p>

<pre><code>Html.ActionLink&lt;TController&gt;(<br />    Expression&lt;Action&lt;TController&gt;&gt; action, String linkText)
Html.ActionLink&lt;TController&gt;(<br />    Expression&lt;Action&lt;TController&gt;&gt; action, String linkText, object attributes)<br /></code></pre>

<p>So, now you can re-write the first example to get the MostRecent() action like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%-- // New way --%&gt;</code><code><br />&lt;%= Html.ActionLink&lt;PostController&gt;(c =&gt; c.MostRecent(), Model.DisplayName)%&gt;<br /></code></pre>

<p>Isn’t that much tidier?&#160; To break it down, TController is the controller you want to access an action method for.&#160; With it assigned as the generic type, now you have intellisense for your controller as the image below demonstrates.</p>

<p>This pattern even supports the parameters on your controller’s actions!&#160; For example, say you want to pass in a username property for a PostController action with the signature of MyPosts(String username).&#160; Using the old method, you have to pass it an anonymous type like so (again, using strings):</p>

<pre>&lt;%-- // Old way --%&gt;<code><br />&lt;%= Html.ActionLink(Model.DisplayName, &quot;MyPosts&quot;, new { Controller=&quot;Post&quot;, id=Model.Username }) %&gt;<br /></code></pre>

<p>With the Futures assembly, it’s a simple as this:</p>

<pre>&lt;%-- // New way --%&gt;<code><br />&lt;%= Html.ActionLink&lt;PostController&gt;(c =&gt; c.MyPosts(Model.Username), Model.DisplayName)%&gt;<br /></code></pre>

<p>Notice that you pass the Model.Username parameter directly into the method c.MyPosts(), instead as an anonymous type like the old way. You even get the intellisense as well, as shown below:</p>

<p><a href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/StronglyTypedMVCwithASP.NETFutures_C956/923200982013PM.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="9-23-2009 8-20-13 PM" border="0" alt="9-23-2009 8-20-13 PM" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/StronglyTypedMVCwithASP.NETFutures_C956/923200982013PM_thumb.png" width="631" height="121" /></a></p>

<h2>Html RenderAction&lt;TController&gt;</h2>

<p>This new function works exactly like the ActionLink&lt;TController&gt; above.&#160; No surprises.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%-- // new way %&gt;
&lt;% Html.RenderAction&lt;PostController&gt;(c =&gt; c.MyPosts(Model.Username));%&gt;<code> </code></code></pre>

<p>You can <a href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/html-renderaction-for-asp-net-mvc-1-0.aspx">read more about RenderAction&lt;TController&gt; here</a>.&#160; </p>

<h2>Strong Typed Html BeginForm&lt;TController&gt;</h2>

<p>Again, using the ASP.NET MVC Futures assembly, this is already done for you.&#160; This one is a bit tricky though.&#160; You want to pass your values within the form’s scope, not the BeginForm method itself.&#160; But, if you leave the parameters blank for your method, the view will not render and you will be an exception.&#160; Intelliense actually gives you a hint by the red underline.</p>

<p><a href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/StronglyTypedMVCwithASP.NETFutures_C956/923200990142PM.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="9-23-2009 9-01-42 PM" border="0" alt="9-23-2009 9-01-42 PM" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/StronglyTypedMVCwithASP.NETFutures_C956/923200990142PM_thumb.png" width="504" height="93" /></a> </p>

<p>To get by this, you have to trick it and pass in some default values like so:</p>

<p><a href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/StronglyTypedMVCwithASP.NETFutures_C956/923200990258PM.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="9-23-2009 9-02-58 PM" border="0" alt="9-23-2009 9-02-58 PM" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/StronglyTypedMVCwithASP.NETFutures_C956/923200990258PM_thumb.png" width="536" height="101" /></a> </p>

<p>Yes, you can still pass a direct value into the method.&#160; And just like normal, if a route’s parameter does not match the name, it will be tacked on as a querystring.&#160; </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>That’s it for now.&#160; There are more to capitalize on within the Futures assembly such as the <strong>FileCollectionModelBinder</strong> for multiple files, the <strong>CookieTempDataProvider</strong> for setting a temp cookie only for the next request, or even the HtmlHelper extensions for <strong>Mailto()</strong> that wraps those ever daunting subject, body, multiple emails, etc all into a neat HtmlHelper.</p>

<p>For my next project, I will be developing heavy in Mvc across multiple sites.&#160; At that point, I am sure I will have more strongly typed extensions for things like RedirectToAction() at the controller level.&#160; I will post them as I run across them.</p>]]></content>

And 30 days before you launch, then get your massive setup and migrate over to it.&#160; You reap the benefits of saving the costs during that time.&#160; If you application(s) are too embedded to be migrated quickly to another set of servers, find a new architect or developer.&#160; </p>  <h2>Microsoft and Open-Source</h2>  <p>I actually have a history with these start-up programs.&#160; It was back in 2006 when I worked on a new Microsoft site called <a href="http://www.microsoftstartupzone.com">www.microsoftstartupzone.com</a> at Telligent.&#160; It was going to be a new low-cost initiative to compete with the free open-source market (LAMP).</p>  <p>One of the first programs to come out of this site was the BizSpark program that we all know and love.&#160; We got BizSpark at GlobalGrind, and I helped setup BizSpark at my former gig as well.&#160; It really is a powerful and inexpensive way to get a company up and going.</p>  <p>And now, we have this WebsiteSpark to get things kicked off.&#160; Excellent.</p>]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Html.RenderAction for ASP.NET MVC 1.0]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P>The <A href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/type-safety-with-asp-net-mvc-futures.aspx" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/type-safety-with-asp-net-mvc-futures.aspx">ASP.NET MVC 1.0 Futures assembly</A> (that is not included with ASP.NET MVC 1.0) has a powerful HtmlHelper extension method called RenderAction().&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds similar to the Html extension method called RenderPartial() for a good reason.&nbsp; RenderAction() executes an action on a controller, allowing you to move your logic out of the views.</P>
<H2>The problem with Html.RenderPartial()</H2>
<P>There is no direct problem with this.&nbsp; It is just that developers are left with only the ability to render a Partial View.&nbsp; What if you want that partial view to act on model properties you pass into that partial view?&nbsp; What if you need to access the ambient values in the Routes collection to render some specifics?&nbsp; Unfortunately, developers are only left with RenderPartial() which only gives you access to a partial view.&nbsp; If you really need this logic, you have no choice but to put it into the partial view.&nbsp; Or, to put it into your controller’s action method that calls the view that calls the partialviews.&nbsp; Needless to say, that’s a bit hokey.</P>
<H2>What Html.RenderAction&lt;TController&gt;() Resolves</H2>
<P>It gives you the power of moving that complex View and Partial View logic to a Controller’s Action, where it belongs!&nbsp; Think of it as a “Render Partial Action” method of where you can call back into a controller to render some logic. This gives you the ability to clean up your partial views now by removing that logic and placing it on a controller’s action, that renders the partial view when done. The syntax looks like:</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;% Html.RenderAction&lt;ProductController&gt;(c =&gt; c.RenderProductResults()); %&gt;<BR></CODE><CODE>&lt;!-- Or... //--&gt;<BR>&lt;%= Html.RenderAction("RenderPartialResults", "Product"); %&gt; </CODE></PRE>
<P>Put simply, this renders an action on a controller directly in your view.&nbsp; You may be thinking “big deal”, but I assure you this is a big deal in large complex MVC sites.&nbsp; Having the power to abstract or breakup your controller’s actions into multiple <EM>partial-actions</EM> and multiple views is very powerful.&nbsp; Instead of relying on the 1 controller' action to wire up all of the data for all of the views, partial views, and logic for the views.&nbsp; Now, you can just focus on that one section - and abstract the rest into reusable parts.</P>
<P>You may be wondering where this extension method is with your ASP.NET MVC project.&nbsp; As mentioned above, it is part of the <A href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/type-safety-with-asp-net-mvc-futures.aspx" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/type-safety-with-asp-net-mvc-futures.aspx">Futures extension of the ASP.NET MVC project at codeplex</A>.</P>
<H2>ASP.NET MVC Sidebar Widget Example</H2>
<P>The current pattern suggests you use Html.RenderPartial to render those partial views as your sidebar widgets.&nbsp; What if you want those widgets to be more complex?&nbsp; What if you want those widgets to act on the the current Route?&nbsp; Well, you are left with little options with RenderPartial.&nbsp; Instead, you want to use RenderAction to call an action on a controller to handle that logic.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Assume we are viewing a blog post entry and on the right, we want a sidebar widget for related posts. To do this, first create an action on a controller called RelatedPosts().</P><PRE><CODE>public ActionResult RelatedPosts(Int32 postID)
{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>  // some complex logic, or simple logic, can go here now…<BR>  //<BR>  <BR>  if (postID &lt; 1)<BR>    return PartialView(“NoRelatedPosts”);<BR>&nbsp; var relatedPosts =<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _postService.FetchRelatedPosts(postID);<BR>  <BR>&nbsp; if (relatedPosts.Count &gt; 0)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; return PartialView("RelatedPosts", relatedPosts);<BR>&nbsp; else<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return PartialView(“NoRelatedPosts”);
}</CODE></PRE>
<P>Notice how the logic here accounts for empty or no results, and returns an a different partial view?&nbsp; Using RenderPartial(), this is logic could only be reflected with inline IF ELSE brackets within your PartialView - and ugly spaghetti mess.&nbsp; Also, how would you even retrieve the related posts collection?&nbsp; You have no choice but to obtain that collection back on the post entry view action - which should not be concerned about our little sidebar widget.&nbsp; All it should do is wire up the post.&nbsp; But, that is not the case with RenderPartial() - you have to wire up all of your data ahead of time in one large ViewModel with multiple entities dangling off of it.</P>
<P>No no.&nbsp; Let’s do it with RenderAction() and instead put this logic into the Controller (where it belongs, so we can test for it); and then, we can call it with the RenderAction() extension.&nbsp; We can do this now with a simple call within our larger post view like so:</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;% Html.RenderAction&lt;PostController&gt;(c =&gt; c.RelatedPosts(Model.PostID)); %&gt; </CODE></PRE>
<P>We instead kind of render a <EM>partial action</EM> by calling an action on a controller that handles the logic that we would otherwise have to put in the view.&nbsp; Now, our main post view action doesn’t have to be concerned about wiring up our sidebar partial view.&nbsp; We can just call RenderAction() in the view.</P>
<H2>ASP.NET MVC AJAX Example using RenderAction</H2>
<P>Taking an example from the book <A href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470384611?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eduncan911com-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470384611" mce_href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470384611?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eduncan911com-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470384611">Profressional ASP.NET MVC 1.0</A>, we’ll use the submitting a Form Using Ajax example to replace the limited RenderPartial() function with a richer RenderAction() from a Controller’s action to process the results more finely.</P>
<P>In the ProductController, you would add a new method with the signature RenderProductResults(IList&lt;Product&gt; products):</P><PRE><CODE>public ActionResult RenderProductResults(IList&lt;Product&gt; products)
{
    // insert some custom logic here, maybe even switch partial views, etc
    //
    if (products.Count &gt; 0)
        return PartialView("ProductSearchResults", products);
    else
        return EmptyResult();
}    </CODE></PRE>
<P>Now, you can update their ajax example to render this new action instead of the RenderPartial() from their example:</P><PRE><CODE>&lt;h1&gt;Product Search - jQuery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;form action="&lt;%= Url.Action("ProductSearch") %&gt;" method="post" id="jform"&gt;

  &lt;%= Html.TextBox("query", null, new { size=40 }) %&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" id="jsubmit" value="go" /&gt; 

&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;div id="results2"&gt;
  &lt;% Html.RenderAction&lt;ProductController&gt;(c =&gt; c.RenderProductResults(Model.Results)); %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src="/Scripts/jquery-1.3.2.js" type="text/javascript"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;<BR>&lt;script src="/Scripts/jquery-form.js" type="text/javascript"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;<BR>&lt;script&gt; <BR>  $(function() { <BR>    $('#jform').submit(function(){ <BR>      $('#jform').ajaxSubmit({ target: '#results2' }); <BR>      return false; <BR>    }); <BR>  });<BR>&lt;/script&gt;</CODE></PRE>
<P>Look for the Html.RenderAction line above.&nbsp; What this does is instead of rendering a partial view in the id=”results2” location, you can now render a “partial Action” with the Html.RenderAction() call.&nbsp; Notice that how we are also passing strongly typed parameters directly into the method?&nbsp; Yep, fully supported.</P>
<P>By using the RenderAction instead of RenderPartial, you have much more control over what happens with that rendering of the partial (now, rendering of the action).&nbsp; <EM><U>This gives you an excellent opportunity to remove that complex view logic you may have, and place it in an Action where it belongs</U></EM>!</P>
<H2>Custom ViewEngines and Extensions</H2>
<P>Now, you can also resolve this logic issue by creating custom ViewEngines, or extensions that expand upon the ViewEngine, HtmlHelper, or UrlHelper.&nbsp; But, I see those methods as more application-wide common logic (like pagers and server controls for display name).&nbsp; I do not see that as a solution for your one-off partial view for the ajax response to something.&nbsp; Think of how bloated your ViewEngine would get, or how many different ViewEngines you’d have to choose from.&nbsp; No, ViewEngine extensions have a place which I will post about as well.</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>When your views start getting complex and messy, it may be time to switch to a RenderAction to handle that logic.&nbsp; I know I have cleaned up quite a lot using it.&nbsp; Also, custom view engines have a place in their own right to abstract more global/common logic across the entire site.</P>[PostIcon]http://www.spacedaily.com/images/solar-impulse-bg.jpg[/PostIcon] ]]></content>

I use an Ajax example to show what you can do with it.  The real power lies in the Html.RenderAction() where you can actually render an action, as a partial view.

Instead of having complex logic in your partial view, you can port that logic to a "Partial Action" on a controller, which will render that partial view for you.  THis gives you the power of putting the complex partial view logic in the controller's action, where it belongs.

I tweaked the post a little to show that one line better.  ]]></content>

My code above is not complete code example - it is in that book (a bit larger).  

For example, in the RenderProductResults() action method in the book, you must be checking for an Ajax post and render the partial view instead of the full view.

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Support Ticket Severity vs Priority]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P><A href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/SupportTicketSeverityvsPriority_11E83/ARG1329_pvw.jpg" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/SupportTicketSeverityvsPriority_11E83/ARG1329_pvw.jpg"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; MARGIN: 0px 20px 0px 0px; DISPLAY: inline; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" title=ARG1329_pvw border=0 alt=ARG1329_pvw align=left src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/SupportTicketSeverityvsPriority_11E83/ARG1329_pvw_thumb.jpg" width=244 height=236 mce_src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/SupportTicketSeverityvsPriority_11E83/ARG1329_pvw_thumb.jpg"></A> All too often, I get involved with ticketing systems that have these set incorrectly.&nbsp; Or, they utilize them in a different manner than what they were intended for.&nbsp; Tonight, I am setting up another system and thought I would document the differences here for future references (and for my buddies that could tweak their systems).</P>
<P>I understand there is a movement to get away from setting both of these.&nbsp; I myself like a system without the severity part, as it is much faster just to run down the priority list.&nbsp; But, I feel that the more formal the QA process is (e.g. you have a dedicated QA member or team or outsourced group), the more you need to separate the two.&nbsp; This post should help with that.</P>
<H2>Definitions of Severity and Priority</H2>
<P>The definitions, in terms of a ticketing system are as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Severity</STRONG> : The level of impact the defect has on the system, overall.&nbsp; Basically, <EM>how serious the bug is</EM>.&nbsp; </P>
<P><STRONG>Priority</STRONG> : The developers order in which to attack, address, or fix the tickets.&nbsp; Ranked usually from Highest to Lowest.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Before going any further, let’s setup the Severity to match what Microsoft uses (<A href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DifferentiatePriorityAndSeverity" target=_blank mce_href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DifferentiatePriorityAndSeverity">sourced from this article</A>, with my spin on it).&nbsp; </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>1 - Exception or Crash </STRONG>: A system crash or anything that loses persistent data.&nbsp; Often times referred to as Show Stoppers.&nbsp; Most of the time your overall exceptions that users see (or get the generic “and error has occurred” page) would fall into this category.&nbsp; Unless related to a new feature being QA’d (see #2 below).</P>
<P><STRONG>2 - New Feature Incomplete</STRONG> : A <EM>new</EM> feature that does not work at all or has exceptions.&nbsp; The word <EM>new</EM> being import there, as broken new feature bugs do not belong in #1 above.</P>
<P><STRONG>3 - Release Feature Bug</STRONG> : A completed feature that can be released, but has some rough edges to iron out further.</P>
<P><STRONG>4 - Cosmetic (UI)</STRONG> : Purely cosmetic, css, html, and spelling issues.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I usually take it a little further by adding a 5th option.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>5 - Feature Request</STRONG> : Usually a placeholder for feature notes and feature development / feedback to the reporter.&nbsp; Some organizations prefer to keep a separate list of these.&nbsp; I find they are too often forgotten about.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is easier to think of severities as categories of the defect itself.&nbsp; Also if you notice, I prefixed the severities with numbers.&nbsp; This has a two effects by giving users an instant “what level is this bug” resolve, as well as a trick to get several ticket systems to order the DropDownList by the number (yeah, lame, but works!).</P>
<H2>Who sets Severity and Priority?</H2>
<P>This is a good one.&nbsp; A few employees at my last company nearly went to war over who gets to set these.&nbsp; But, the answer is simple:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>It’s the tester/bug reporter’s job to set the severity.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The person in charge of QAing the system knows the severity of the bug they are reporting.&nbsp; They know how it impacts the users on the other end.&nbsp; But, this person should not be given the power to set the priority.&nbsp; Else, everything would be set to High Priority (usually the case).</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><EM>Priority should be set by the project manager or dispatcher.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>During the weekly standup, the project manager decides on what order the tickets are addressed in and this, in turn, dictates the priority of the tickets.&nbsp; This is done by examining the severity of the bug reported (yep, there it is - examine the severity here!).&nbsp; After reviewing the severity, the PM estimates the time to resolve the bug for the next milestone or release and decides if it is acceptable.&nbsp; If so, a priority is set on the ticket and it is moved to the appropriate milestone.</P>
<H2>Severity and Priority Examples</H2>
<P>Let’s take an example of an css issue in which the overflow property is not set correctly, and the text the user sees is being obscured by this issue.&nbsp; But, this css issue is part of a new feature that is going out in the next build.&nbsp; What do you set it to?&nbsp; Is it #2, a feature incomplete?&nbsp; Or #3, a feature bug because the user cannot set the text of this “new” feature?&nbsp; Or, #4, an UI issue?</P>
<P>Personally, this is to each his own.&nbsp; I would examine the context of the text being hidden.&nbsp; If this text is the balance of your bank account being hidden, then that is a #2.&nbsp; If it is part of the help text, then #3 and can be released to be tweaked later.&nbsp; If it is just a few words not needed for any operation or description of the page’s purpose, then, it’s #4 and can wait for more sever issues to be addressed.</P>
<P>Basically, the severity dictates rather that bug must be completed before release.&nbsp; I usually set the rule that the release does not go out with any #1 and #2s in the list.&nbsp; Or, I may release some #2s if I can quickly follow-up with a patch within a day or two.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Number 3s and 4s often time get pushed back until the next release, unless the priority has been bumped (i.e. how old a ticket is).&nbsp; The #3s and #4s are great gap fillers for those "let's run through the tickets and attack as many as we can" days.</P>
<P>If you need more examples, feel free to hit me up or leave a comment.</P>
<H2>Summary</H2>
<P>Hopefully you have a better idea of severity and how it fits into your project management.&nbsp; Again, I have to stress that smaller projects may never use severity.&nbsp; But, if you have any type of format QA process, it makes sense to stick it in there to have the extra level of communications.</P>
<P>In case you are wondering, I personally use Unfuddle at my companies and personal projects.&nbsp; You can’t beat the web version of diffmerge in the browser!&nbsp; GitHub is very good as well for those diffmerges.&nbsp; GitHub is best suited for public projects and very small teams, and is only for Git.&nbsp; Where Unfuddle supports both Git and SVN, and is more privatized. </P>]]></content>

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[Windows Azure SDK for Microsoft Visual Studio November 2009]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<P><A href="http://eduncan911.com/blogs/eduncan911/productsoverviewinfographic_677ADB3A.gif" mce_href="http://eduncan911.com/blogs/eduncan911/productsoverviewinfographic_677ADB3A.gif"><IMG style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; WIDTH: 637px; DISPLAY: inline; HEIGHT: 191px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; BORDER-RIGHT: 0px" title=products-overview-infographic border=0 alt=products-overview-infographic src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/products-overview-infographic.gif" width=637 height=191 mce_src="/blog/thumbnail/products-overview-infographic.gif"></A> </P>
<P>Over this past weekend, Microsoft released an updated Windows Azure SDK dated November 2009 for Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 Beta 2.&nbsp; It is great to hear this since my tinkering with with the old CTP release was a bit buggy (had to download a few hot-fixes).&nbsp; </P>
<P>Officially this SDK is known as version 20091111.1401, and released on November 13th, 2009.&nbsp; <A href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=128752" target=_blank mce_href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=128752">You can go straight to the SDK download here</A>.</P>
<P>I have compiled a list of improvements and details about this release.&nbsp; For those new to Windows Azure, the SDK add-on for Visual Studio 2008/2010 includes the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>C# and VB Project creation support for creating a Windows Azure Cloud Service solution with multiple roles.</LI>
<LI>Tools to add and remove roles from the Cloud Service.</LI>
<LI>Tools to configure each Role.</LI>
<LI>Integrated local development via the Development Fabric and Development Storage services.</LI>
<LI>Running and Debugging a Cloud Service in the Development Fabric.</LI>
<LI>Building and packaging of Cloud Service Packages.</LI>
<LI>Browsing to the Windows Azure Developer Portal.</LI></UL>
<P>This updated includes a large number of enhancements and compatibility updates.&nbsp; The overview reads:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Windows Azure Service Runtime managed library: The latest version of the Service Hosting Runtime API includes support for enhanced communication between roles and for runtime notification of service configuration changes. Direct communication between role instances enables new application development scenarios, including applications that distribute state across role instances. Service configuration changes include an increase or decrease in the number of request role instances and changes to the values of configuration settings.</LI>
<LI>Windows Azure Diagnostics managed library: The new Diagnostics API enables logging using standard .NET APIs. The Diagnostics API provides built-in support for collecting standard logs and diagnostic information, including the Windows Azure logs, IIS 7.0 logs, Failed Request logs, crash dumps, Windows Event logs, performance counters, and custom logs. </LI>
<LI>Certificate Management: Enhanced support for SSL certificates in Windows Azure and in the Windows Azure SDK enables the secure automated deployment of certificates to services hosted on Windows Azure. </LI>
<LI>Variable-size Virtual Machines : Developers may now specify the size of the virtual machine to which they wish to deploy a role instance, based on the role's resource requirements. The size of the VM determines the number of CPU cores, the memory capacity, and the local file system size allocated to a running instance. </LI>
<LI>External endpoints for worker roles. A worker role may now define any number of external endpoints for HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP, and specify the desired port number for any external endpoint. </LI>
<LI>Persistent local resource storage: Developers can now choose to persist data written to a local storage resource at runtime when the role is recycled. </LI>
<LI>Windows Azure Storage Client managed library: The Storage Client library provides a .NET API for accessing the Windows Azure storage services. </LI>
<LI>Improved Development Storage: Development storage provides a high-fidelity simulation of the Windows Azure storage services in the cloud. Tables can now be created dynamically in the development storage Table service and are no longer required to be generated in advance. </LI>
<LI>Updated samples: The samples included with the Windows Azure SDK have been updated to demonstrate new features. The samples now include both C# and Visual Basic versions.</LI></UL>
<P>The actual technical updates are listed below.&nbsp; Some interesting parts such as ASP.NET MVC 2 support are now included.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Service Model UI: A redesigned and significantly more complete interface for manipulating Role configuration information. To access, double-click on a role node in the Solution Explorer.</LI>
<LI>Additional role templates: Support for ASP.NET MVC 2 (2010 only), F# worker roles (2010 only), and WCF Service Application web roles.</LI>
<LI>VS2010 Beta2 Support: Support for Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 and VWD Express 2010 Beta 2.</LI>
<LI>Support for dynamically creating tables: The Create Tables functionality is now performed automatically; there is no longer a need to right-click and select Create Tables… on the project after your table definitions have changed.</LI>
<LI>Full support for and installation of the November Windows Azure SDK release (in short, similar to the above list):</LI>
<UL>
<LI>The sample storage client has been replaced by a new production quality library.</LI>
<LI>New Diagnostics library enables logging using .NET APIs and enables the collection of diagnostic information from the service.</LI>
<LI>Service Runtime library updated to support inter-role communication and notification of configuration changes . </LI>
<LI>Support for input endpoints on Worker Roles. </LI>
<LI>Higher fidelity simulation of Development Storage: supports all current cloud storage features, including dynamically creating tables. </LI>
<LI>Ability to choose the size of the VM for a role instance. </LI>
<LI>Ability to persist data in local storage even after the role is recycled. </LI>
<LI>Ability to manage certificates to install to the role VMs. </LI></UL></UL>]]></content>

<P>What has bugged me a bit is getting TestDriven.NET to see my MSpec specifications, on my Windows 7 x64 platform.&nbsp; Aaron so kindly includes a InstallTDNetRunner.bat file to register MSpec with TestDrive.NET; but, it only works on x86 systems.</P>
<P>So why does it not work with x64 systems?&nbsp; It is because the installer for TestDriven.NET registers the runners in a different registry location.</P>

<P>Below, I have created a bat file you can copy and paste into your own InstallTDNetRunner-x64.bat if you are on Windows x64.&nbsp; Or, you can download it from here: </P>

<H2>Setup TestDriven.NET and MSpec</H2>
<P>Still a bit confused, getting TestDriven.NET and MSpec setup for the first time? Here's the steps to follow:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Go ahead and install TestDriven.NET.&nbsp; It can be installed and upgraded at any time. </LI>
<LI>Next, grab <A href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/aaron.jensen/archive/tags/mspec/default.aspx" target=_blank mce_href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/aaron.jensen/archive/tags/mspec/default.aspx">the latest release of MSpec</A>&nbsp; and extract the zip to a semi-permanent location.&nbsp; This is because things such as ReSharper and TestDriven.NET will need to know a common location for the mspec assemblies.&nbsp; I recommend C:\Program Files (x86)\MSpec\. 
<UL>
<LI>Included with the MSpec zip is an InstallTDNetRunner.bat, but it only works on 32-bit Windows.&nbsp; For 64-bit Windows, you want to copy my registry code above into a new file called InstallTDNetRunner-x64.bat. </LI>
<LI>Make sure to place this InstallTDNetRunner-x64.bat file in the same directory as your semi-permanent MSpec location above. </LI></UL></LI>
<LI>Finally, you want to double-click and execute the InstallTDNetRunner or InstallTDNetRunner-x64 from within this semi-permanent location.&nbsp; This will insert the registry values for a new runner called MSpec for TestDriven.NET to detect and execute. </LI></UL>
<P>From this point further, you can right-click within different places to execute your specifications within your MSpec.&nbsp; Some tips on locations you can right-click and execute the specs:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The project file: will execute all specs detected within that project. </LI>
<LI>The Namespace: will execute all specs detected within that namespace throughout the project. </LI>
<LI>Within the <FONT face="Courier New">Establish context</FONT> or <FONT face="Courier New">Because of</FONT> : Will execute all specs within that one class/scenario. </LI>
<LI>Within the <FONT face="Courier New">It</FONT> spec - Will execute just that one test. </LI></UL>
<P>Something to note is Aaron is currently upgrading MSpec (version 0.4, not released yet) to support TestDriven.NET's new 2.24 feature of version independent runners. I haven't looked completely into that myself, but should make registring TDNet runners in the future a bit easier.</P>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[I tried out your batch file for 64 bit win 7 and I'm  no longer getting 

"The target type doesn't contain tests from a known test framework or a 'Main' method." 

So I guess thats progress. However, now my simple sample spec output shows nothing but the 

"------ Test started: Assembly: Sample.Tests.dll ------"

Below is a the test

[Subject("Creating an Organization")]
public class when_adding_an_item : to_empty_list_of_organizations
{

    It should_add_one_organization_to_the_list_of_organizations;

}

public abstract class to_empty_list_of_organizations
{
    protected static Organization org;
    Establish context = () =>
    {
        org = new Organization();
    };
}

Any ideas on how I could get TD.Net to show the "Not Implemented" message with MSpec.

I'm using xUnit 1.5 and TD.Net 2.24 and the MSpec from here:

http://teamcity.codebetter.com/guestAuth/repository/download/bt44/.lastSuccessful/Machine.Specifications-release.zip

I had previously run the normal InstallTDNetRunner.bat from another location before reading your post. I had also previously installed the TD.Net version 3 beta. But uninstalled and went back to 2.24.

Any hints would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Ben

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p>This new Microsoft feature in .NET Framework 4 is a programming model for reusing components, very similar to those Inversion of Control container frameworks out there that we all know and love (Castle Windsor, Structured Map, their own Unity from the Patterns and Practices team and etc).&nbsp; Now, they have built their own to address the pain points of these frameworks called the Managed Extensibility Framework, or MEF for short.</p> <p>I was pleasantly surprised this weekend when reading the February 02010's issue of MSDN Magazine.&nbsp; Getting up-to-speed on some new features in .NET Framework 4, I saw the headline "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee291628.aspx" target="_blank">Building Composable Apps in .NET 4 with the Managed Extensibility Framework</a>" by Glenn Block.&nbsp; Yeah, it just rolls off your tongue eh?&nbsp; So I decided I had a few minutes while waiting for the water to boil and scanned the article.&nbsp; I am glad I did.</p> <p>In this post, I will try to give a very brief overview on how to use MEF coming from a background of using other Inversion of Control (IoC) containers, including some of the gotchas that you must be aware of during the switch.&nbsp; Yeah, you will want to make the switch - the switch away from those other bulky frameworks.&nbsp; I, for one, am officially announcing my abandonment of Castle and Unity for all future projects.&nbsp; Because once you add-in .NET 4's new data annotations for seriously improved validation, mixed with MEF, the only other 3rd party component I am left with is Castle's Logger abstraction - which I am hoping I can find a replacement for with .NET 4's new features.</p> <h2>MEF Terminology</h2> <p>First and fore-most for those of you already using an IoC container, it's time for a quick review on what MEF calls a few things and concepts.&nbsp; Below is a table I whipped up to help compare the two terminologies (the MEF portions largely taken from Glenn's excellent article).</p> <p>&nbsp;<img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="2-15-2010 10-41-32 PM" border="0" alt="2-15-2010 10-41-32 PM" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/ManagedExtensibilityFrameworkMicrosoftsO_A9C4/2152010104132PM_3.png" width="832" height="649"> </p> <p>Below is an image from Glenn's article that helps visualize the concepts above of MEF.</p> <p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="ee291628_Block_Fig1(en-us,MSDN_10)" border="0" alt="ee291628_Block_Fig1(en-us,MSDN_10)" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/ManagedExtensibilityFrameworkMicrosoftsO_A9C4/ee291628_Block_Fig1enusMSDN_10.png" width="413" height="288"> </p> <p>You can see that the overall concept is called Composition.&nbsp; A 'part' is the type or service you want to export.&nbsp; The part (or parts) is marked for Export via Contracts (which are automatic).&nbsp; And other parts that want to ask for another part can do so by Importing.</p> <h2>Managed Extensibility Framework - Why they built it</h2> <p>Glenn mentions in the article that they needed a way to compose of reusable types or components in the up coming Visual Studio 2010, Oslo, Acropolis and I am sure many more.&nbsp; What is important to note is why they created one themselves, instead of using Unity or alike.&nbsp; Glenn mentions some key points:</p> <ul> <li>Third-party Extensibility (allowing vendors to generate plug-ins for Visual Studio, or your own application, with minimal work on your part now)  <li>Other frameworks were too heavyweight for a simple programming model.&nbsp; <li>Or other frameworks required too much effort on the part of either the host or the extension developer. </li></ul> <p>Those last two is what struck a cord with me, and got my attention.&nbsp; Try to sit back and think about how you would allow your applications to be extended with Castle, StructureMap or even Unity.&nbsp; That's a lot of work, a lot of 3rd party assemblies to wire up and configure properly.&nbsp; Especially if you want runtime changes, which MEF supports out of the box with no configuration.</p> <p>That last point is particularly interesting.&nbsp; All too often I see a released developer framework or contrib project by a group of inspired individuals.&nbsp; This is great and all, but those projects quickly grow to be a large project requiring documentation, support, and even refactorings for performance.</p> <p>It got me thinking a lot about what I see wrong with Castle - only two things, it's learning curve and size.&nbsp; While Unity was very well documented, it comes with some significant bloat and only what I can refer to as hoop-jumping.&nbsp; The earlier versions of Unity violated Dependency Injection pricipals and concepts (no ctor injection!).&nbsp; Perfect example of refactoring.</p> <p>MEF really strives to resolve all of these issues, with some extremely simple programming models that I will show you below.</p> <p></p> <h2>MEF Programming Models - Straight Attributed Declarations</h2> <p>Another rip from Glenn's article.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did it so well.</p> <blockquote> <p>Developers consume MEF through a programming model.&nbsp; A programming model provides a means to declare components as MEF parts.&nbsp; Out of the box, MEF provides an attributed programming model, which will be the main focus of this article.&nbsp; That model is just one of many possible programming models that MEF enables.&nbsp; MEF's core API is completely agnostic to attributes.</p></blockquote> <p>Yep, you heard that right.&nbsp; MEF supports Attributes - for out-of-the-box functionality.&nbsp; No configuration, no setup, nothing.&nbsp; This is so much easier than you are even thinking.&nbsp; So much so, I feel guilty by writing all of this text.&nbsp; Let's just show you how it's done now.</p> <h2>The Blog "Hello World" Snippets</h2> <p>As what seems to be an invasion, the common Hello World for websites these days <a href="http://invalidlogic.com/2008/12/22/blogging-apps-are-the-new-hello-world/" target="_blank">are blogs</a>.&nbsp; So without further delay, here's some code snippets.</p> <p>The post object</p> <p></p><pre><code>
public partial class Post
{
	public Int32 PostId { get; set; }
	public String Title { get; set; }
	public String Description { get; set; }
	public String Body { get; set; }
	public Guid AuthorId { get; set; }
}

</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>And the PostService that will service the post.</p>
<p></p><pre><code>
[Export(typeof(IPostService))]
public class PostService : IPostService
{
	[Import]
	public IPostRepository PostRepository { get; set; }

	public Post FetchById(Int32 postId)
	{
		return
			(from p in PostRepository.GetAll()
			 where p.PostId == postId
			 select p as Post).FirstOrDefault();
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the above code is not production-code.&nbsp; You should always provide proper cache, concurrency and disposable patterns.&nbsp; This code has been cleaned up for easier reading.</p>
<p>Notice that the PostService has been marked to be exportable, using a specific contract type for IPostService. Now, you do not have to specify the contract type or name. You can simply use [Export]. But remember, we do want to allow for simply extensibility in the future by plugging in different components to be served during composition.&nbsp; How to do that?&nbsp; Easy, just specify the interface type as the contract.&nbsp; Now how easy was that?</p>
<p>Also, notice that we have a dependency on IPostRepository. This is marked with the simple [Import] attribute.&nbsp; It does exactly as you think.&nbsp; MEF composes the first part that matches the contract for IPostRepository and supplies it </p>
<p>Now, some will cry fowl here since I am not directly injecting IPostRepository, or not demanding it in the constructor. Yes, MEF fully supports constructor injection. But, there is a few gotchas you have to be aware of with MEF and constructor composition that I get into a little further down. There's also a new pattern I am designing, when mixed with .NET 4 and some nifty T4 templates I'm tinkering with. That's another article I'll write though. Check the comments, or leave a comment for more information on, "Managing BDD Contexts and Mocks Automatically with .NET 4, MEF, and T4 Templates." Nice. I just named my next blog post. </p>
<h2>Constructor Dependency Injection - MEF Gotcha</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, constructor injection is a bit tricky with MEF.&nbsp; There are some rules to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>MEF assumes all parameters are imports, making the import attribute unnecessary.&nbsp; I leave it up to the reader to figure out how to get around this. 
<li>Recomposition is not supported on constructor parameters.</li></ul>
<p>That last one is almost a deal breaker for me.&nbsp; Recomposition is a feature of MEF that allows parts to automatically have their imports updated as new matching exports appear in the system.&nbsp; Given, this isn't the case with most websites out there.&nbsp; It's an issue for websites and applications that want to support dynamic (e.g. downloadable) plugins.&nbsp; The plugins would overwrite, at runtime, certain contracts and therefore allow the parts to automatically be updated with the new plugin versions - all without an application restart!</p>
<p>So with that said (and you will never be developing plugins right?), you can use constructor injection with MEF as follows.</p>
<p><pre><code>
[Export(typeof(IPostService))]
public class PostService : IPostService
{
	private IPostRepository _postRepo;
	private IUserRepository _userRepo

	[ImportingConstructor]
	public PostService(IPostRepository postRepo, IUserRepository userRepo)
	{
		_postRepo = postRepo;
		_userRepo = userRepo;
	}

	public Post FetchById(Int32 postId)
	{
		return
			(from p in _postRepo.GetAll()
			 where p.PostId == postId
			 select p as Post).FirstOrDefault();
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p>Don't fret too much though about the all-or-nothing constructor.&nbsp; You have a Factory option later on in this post.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping MEF for Application Startup</h2>
<p>Glenn nailed it right on the head when he called this procedure "bootstrapping."&nbsp; I've always struggled with the proper terminology for this composition process with other Inversion of Control containers.&nbsp; Bootstrapping.&nbsp; Yep, just like my hacked MP3 players have.</p>
<p>To get things up and running, you will need to to insert some bootstrapping code for your application.&nbsp; This code is required with any type of IoC container, and with MEF as well.</p>
<p>Below is a small code snippet from a typical ASP.NET MVC 2 global.asax file.&nbsp; Notice I added the two using blocks at the end of the Application_Start().&nbsp; This process would be the same for any type of application you have.</p>
<p><pre><code>
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using System.ComponentModel.Composition.Hosting;

protected void Application_Start()
{
	AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();

	RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);

	using (var catalog = new DirectoryCatalog(@".\"))
	{
		using (var container = new CompositionContainer(catalog))
		{
			container.ComposeParts(this);
		}
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Now, this code is running from with the website assembly.&nbsp; If you, like me, create a seperate assembly to hold your Domain and Repository models, then you simply reference the assembly by replacing the 'this' keyword with Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(MyProject.Domain)).&nbsp; And yes, you can reference multiple catalogs and assemblies and build up your list as well.</p>
<p>Note that I included the namespaces here.&nbsp; This is important as normally this bootstrapping code is in the Hosting namespace.&nbsp; What they don't tell you is there is an extension in the namespace one higher for CompositionContainer, that enables the ComposeParts() extension method in the System.ComponentModel.Composition namespace.</p>
<p>There are tons of options here with the composition containers.&nbsp; Please refer to the .NET 4 documentation on MEF, as well as Glenn's article for a few more tips.&nbsp; You can specify an assembly to reference for the catalog.&nbsp; You can have aggregated catalogs for grouping/namespacing purposes.&nbsp; And yet, you can still have that aged-old configuration file if you really really really want to manually register (export) each type.</p>
<h2>All Parts are Singletons, out of the box</h2>
<p>Yep.&nbsp; All of your part's instances are composed and referenced throughout all of your code as singletons (or "statics").&nbsp; This is a great solution for that stubborn developer you may have working in your group that just won't let go of static managers.&nbsp; Make it instance based, and slap an [Export] on it.&nbsp; Done, now use [Import] wherever you like.</p>
<p>This is important to note because Castle and StructuredMap both default to transient composition (Unity uses whatever you configured the container to use as default).&nbsp; So, make sure you are coding to be thread-safe if you are making the switch over to MEF.</p>
<p>But do not fret, it's easy to specify the lifestyle within the contract definitions.&nbsp; There are three possible configurations you can set with the [PartCreationPolicy()] attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>CreationPolicy.Shared (singleton, default) 
<li>CreationPolicy.NonShared (transient) 
<li>CreationPolicy.Any</li></ul>
<p>The "Any" option is interesting as it leaves it up to the context configuration of the host and/or the configuration of the [Import] contract to specify.&nbsp; You can use RequiredCreationPolicy on the [Import] contract definition to specify the preference.</p>
<p><pre><code>
[PartCreationPolicy(CreationPolicy.Any)]
[Export(typeof(IUserAccountService))]
public class UserAccountService : IUserAccountService
{
	...
}

public class Post
{
	public Int32 PostId { get; set; }
	public String Title { get; set; }
	...

	[Import(RequiredCreationPolicy=CreationPolicy.NonShared]
	public IUserService UserService { get; set; }
}

</pre></code>
<p>There is a problem with this concept though.&nbsp; With a current project we are working on at the moment, we identified the need to have a security context around our services to ensure the current WebRequest has the correct security credentials.&nbsp; With this, we elected to use Castle's WebRequest lifestyle feature.&nbsp; Sadly, this is not possible (yet) with the PartCreationPolicy.&nbsp; So it is left up to the implementer to handle custom composition on their own with a Factory pattern (see below).</p>
<h2>Lazy Loading within Entities</h2>
<p>Those of you that are wanting Lazy Loading within your entities, but are struggling with a solution that is compatible with Inversion of Control, fear not!&nbsp; The answer is now possible with MEF.</p><pre><code>
public partial class Post
{
	[Range(0, Int32.MaxValue)]
	public Int32 PostId { get; set; }
	
	[Required, StringLength(64, MinimumLength = 5)]
	public String Title { get; set; }

	[Required, StringLength(1024, MinimumLength = 5)]
	public String Description { get; set; }

	[Required, StringLength(Int32.MaxValue, MinimumLength = 5)]
	public String Body { get; set; }

	[Required]
	public Guid AuthorId { get; set; }

	[Import]
	public IUserService UserService { get; set; }

	private User _user;
	public User Author
	{
		get
		{
			if (_user == null)
				_user = UserService.FetchById(this.AuthorId);
			return _user;
		}
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p>With our updated Post entity, notice we now have a dependency on IUserService marked with the [Import] attribute.&nbsp; Yep, MEF composes that for you, and you have the UserService to access your lazy objects as needed.</p>
<h2>Using MEF as a Static Wrapper</h2>
<p>Time and time again I find myself writing wrapper classes around static members of a 3rd party component, just so I can unit test my code without having to rely on that static class.&nbsp; Using MEF, if you haven't guesses already, is just as easy as you might think.</p>
<p></p><pre><code>
public class Loggerpart
{
	[Export]
	public ILogger Logger
	{
		get
		{
			return LogManager.GetLogger("LoggerInstance", "config");
		}
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>This pattern allows you to make a wrapper around any 3rd party or legacy code.</p>
<h2>MEF Composition with a Factory Pattern</h2>
<p>Here's another one not in Glenn's article.&nbsp; How to use MEF with a factory pattern to initiate a complex type.</p>
<p><pre><code>
public class UserService : IUserService
{
	public UserService(ISecurityContext securityContext)
	{
		...
	}
}

public class UserServiceFactory
{
	[Export(typeof(IUserService))]
	[PartCreationPolicy(CreationPolicy.Shared)]
	public IUserService Instance
	{
		get
		{
			var context = HttpContext.Current;
			var securityContext = 
				SecurityContextProvider.Setup(context)
			return new UserService(securityContext);
		}
	}
}

</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p>Notice how the UserService is not exported?&nbsp; Instead, we designate a property member of UserServiceFactory called Instance as the Export composition location.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Remember, you are only Exporting for Composition at runtime.&nbsp; Nothing gets composed during your unit tests, as you are mocking them.&nbsp; So anywhere you use [Import] will be still be mockable for any of your unit tests with this pattern.</p>
<h2>Exporting with Multiple Contracts</h2>
<p>Here's a nice trick, you can specify multiple Export contracts for multiple types.&nbsp; Why would you do this?&nbsp; If you are a big DDD follower, you may be using IUserService and IAccountService combined to give you an UserAccountService part.</p>
<p><pre><code>
[Export(typeof(IUserService))]
[Export(typeof(IAccountService))]
public class UserAccountService : IUserService, IAccountService
{
	...
}</code><code>
</pre></code>
<p></p>
<h2>MEF Does Not Blow Up on Rejection</h2>
<p>This one is going to take some getting used to.&nbsp; As Glenn mentions, MEF does not throw exceptions if a part cannot be satisfied.&nbsp; It simply will not exist in the object graph for MEF to return - you'll get a null, and will most likely see a NullReferenceException in your containing code that is trying to use the part you wanted to import.</p>
<p>MEF will simply reject the request for the Import of a part for a number of reasons.&nbsp; For example, if there is no part defined as the correct Export contract type.&nbsp; Say you wanted to import IUserService, but only exported UserService with [Export] and no contract type of IUserService was defined.&nbsp; That was the typical one I found myself forgetting to do.&nbsp; As recommended above, always include the Contract Type when designated a part as Export with [Export(typeof(IUserService))].</p>
<p>I agree that MEF's Rejection policy is a power feature because it stabilizes the code and allows debugging.&nbsp; Glenn links to a good article on why to ensure application stability: <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2009/08/02/stable-composition-in-mef-preview-6.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2009/08/02/stable-composition-in-mef-preview-6.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2009/08/02/stable-composition-in-mef-preview-6.aspx</a></p>
<p>But in short, if you get Rejection happening quite often, check your Export contract definition on your part.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>As you can see, it is dead simple to use MEF.&nbsp; The Export functionality is what was missing with Unity, and completely with all other IoC containers.&nbsp; And, it's what gives MEF such great, simplistic power.&nbsp; I highly recommend reading through Glenn's complete article, as he covers a few other concepts such as using the new <strong>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</strong> for importing lazy exports and metadata.</p>
<p>Some additional things Glenn covers is the very strong support for debugging and tracing, things you want to be aware of if you use MEF even moderately.&nbsp; He also hints at the up-n-coming support for MEF with IronRuby.&nbsp; He also covers some external links, which I will list here (for my own archiving purposes):</p>

<p>Once concept I am tinkering with is utilizing the [Import] attribute in the attributed programming model of MEF to define the complete contexts of my BDD tests for me with all dependencies already mocked up and ready, with T4 templates largely driving that effort.</p>
<p>MEF wacked me upside the head.&nbsp; It does everything right, and even allowed me to step back and realized, "Dang. I was bloating my code."&nbsp; Yes, they have done it right.&nbsp; So right that the next project I am starting this week will be on Visual Studio 2010 RC - not even released yet.&nbsp; </p>]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[Nice post Eric. I like the way you broke down the benefits MEF brings to the table. I do have a bit of an issue with the "MEF is the MS IoC container" angle :-) It is not to say that MEF does not support IoC, it does, but it's about how it supports it and the design goals. Both of which should be evaluated before simply jumping off your current IoC mechanism.

I posted a while ago on how MEF compares to a conventional IoC. It is worth a read for anyone reading this post: http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2009/08/16/should-i-use-mef-for-my-general-ioc-needs.aspx

Aside from that, I do have few questions / observations on the post. 

One the lazy example, doesn't appear to be lazy. Also it is not showing anything that other container's don't already support. MEF does allow imports to be Lazy<T> or Lazy<T,M> which delays instantiation of components.

Second question is wrt to the App Startup code. I am having a hard time seeing how that code as is is particularly useful. Are you expecting the app startup has imports on it? Being brutally honest, there are a bunch of challenges around using MEF on the web, and I think this is oversimplifying it. To really be useful you need to create hiearchical containers in order to manage request-level scoping of components and such. I am not saying the approach of a simple app-level container has no usefulness, but it is limited.
Hammett addresses a lot of these concerns in the code for his post here: http://blogs.msdn.com/hammett/archive/2009/04/23/mef-and-asp-net-mvc-sample.aspx. We are looking into more rudimentry support for ASP.NET scenarios going forward.

Thanks

Thanks for the reply!

Ah, excellent catch about the lazy loading.  After I re-read your article, I see now that MEF would immediately wire that up - so it isn't really lazy loading in the sense of UserService is immediately available.  

Yep, the Lazy<T> sounds about right for what I would need to implement there.  I will make corrections shortly on that - and actually write some code for it (everything above is pseudo code).  

Which, explains the global.asax code above.  I was following your example in the article.  I will look into the mvc and mef article you posted, as this interests me greatly.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks man!]]></content>

          <content type="text"><![CDATA[No problem Eric. The sample in my article was around using the Application class in WPF/SL. These are different because they are stateful and correspond to a single "session" / instance. In the web things are much more complex as the Application is global and shared across many many requests. Those requests are transient rather than stateful.

I hint at some of the intracacies in the bottom of this post: http://codebetter.com/blogs/glenn.block/archive/2010/01/15/hosting-mef-within-your-applications.aspx

Glad to help.

I touch on the power of property exports here: http://codebetter.com/blogs/glenn.block/archive/2010/01/27/how-do-i-expose-configuration-information-through-mef.aspx

One thing on the factory though, depending on the desired behavior you may want to set the creation policy to non shared. For example your user service is using HttpContext.Current. Well if that service is in an global application-level container, you won't get the desired result, as the single instance will get shared across all requests. 

This is because if it shared, MEF will only invoke the property once. However, if you change it to non-shared each call will create a new instance, which is probably what you want.]]></content>

I believe the current .NET 4.5 way of registering for Silverlight projects is to use the nuget package, and then place your composable parts in the /parts/ folder of your solution.

      <title type="text"><![CDATA[.NET 4.0, HTML, and A potentially dangerous Request.Form value]]></title>
      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="validation" border="0" alt="validation" align="right" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/ApotentiallydangerousRequest.Formvalue.0_12CAD/validation.jpg" width="312" height="244" /> I ran across a breaking change tonight in the .NET 4.0 CLR's version of ASP.NET.&#160; The 4.0 version of the CLR binds to any HTTP request data to validate against.</p>  <p>The entire error you may see is:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client</em></p> </blockquote>  <p>This is because 4.0 now inspects all request data.&#160; Rather that being the cookies, urls, headers, etc.&#160; A very nice security upgrade, I might say.&#160; This will prevent a hacker from submitting malicious code through cookies or other means that you may be parsing. </p>  <h2>WYSIWYG and/or HTML Editors with .NET 4.0's CLR</h2>  <p>One common issue that immediately creeps up with this new security is when you want to use a rich-text editor or even a textbox that you want to submit HTML data through.&#160; This seems to be now impossible with .NET 4.0's CLR's default validation because you cannot override this behavior, if you remain in 4.0's validation.</p>  <p>And no, there is no way to selectively disable which items to validate.</p>  <h2>ASP.NET MVC's ValidateInput attribute does not work</h2>  <p>You, like me, most likely just slapped a big ol' fat <font face="Courier New">[ValidateInput]</font> attribute on your MVC controller's action method and thought you were done.&#160; But behold, the error still remains!</p>  <p>This is because your MVC website is running on the .NET 4.0 CLR and therefore continues to be validated.</p>  <h2>The Fix: HttpRuntime requestValidationMode</h2>  <p>The work-around is to place this into your web.config's <font face="Courier New">&lt;system.web&gt;</font> node:</p>  <p></p>  <pre><code>
&lt;httpRuntime requestValidationMode=&quot;2.0&quot; /&gt;

</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>What this does is it forces the CLR to only check the Page's html fields, which you can now overwrite with the <font face="Courier New">[ValidateInput]</font> attribute in MVC controllers, or the <font face="Courier New">&lt;%@ Page validateRequest=&quot;false&quot; %&gt;</font>, or any other normal means. </p>

<p>Sadly though, this also disables all of those other checks for the request data.&#160; Obviously, this is not a preferred work-around and even though VS 2010 is due for release on April 12th (just around the corner!), I do not see any notations of this being changed anytime soon.</p>

<p>If someone knows a work around for 4.0, please let me know.&#160; This is a great new feature, but sadly we must disable it for just about any website we develop on.</p>

<p>Unless we move to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">MarkDown</a> that is (which I am a big fan of, clients not so much…).</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.configuration.httpruntimesection.requestvalidationmode(VS.100).aspx" target="_blank">You can find out more information about this over at MSDN</a></p>]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[<p><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Mei sleeping on our couch." border="0" alt="Mei sleeping on our couch." align="left" src="http://eduncan911.com/blog/thumbnail/How-to-Take-a-Nap_CD86/V__A2E1_thumb.jpg" width="256" height="193" />You may think you know how to take a nap.&#160; Lie down, close eyes, and whenever you wake up that's it.&#160; As it turns out, anything beyond 30 minutes puts you into danger of biting your work colleagues heads off when they interrupt you at 40 or 50 minutes into your nap.</p>  <p>I find myself constantly giving this advice to my work colleagues and family members.&#160; So, here's a blog post on what works very well for me.</p>  <p>There was a British study I read some 6 or so years ago that concluded a simple formula for power napping.&#160; And ever since I started to use this formula, it has worked wonders for my afternoon concentration.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>  <p>First and foremost, caffeine is your enemy here.&#160; If you are a 2+ cups of coffee drinker a day, &quot;because I need it to get going&quot;, then you may have to look elsewhere to prepare.&#160; There's nothing you can do when you crash in the afternoon but to drink more caffeine. </p>  <p>One idea would be to switch to Japanese Green Tea (not the cheap store-brands, but actual shredded green leafs that you control the dosage with).&#160; It is said that the caffeine in Japanese Green Tea absorbs at a much slower pace than coffee, which is less of a shock to your body (and lasts longer).&#160; This could allow you to come down from that high more easily, and allow a power nap.</p>  <p>I actually went caffeine-free for about 6 solid years.&#160; It completely changes your sleep habits (for the good).&#160; The only caffeine I take now is a cup of imported Japanese Green Tea in the morning (but no later than 12 noon), and a piece of chocolate here and there once a week or so.</p>  <p><strong>1. Remove all distractions.</strong></p>  <p>Turn off the computer, all distractions, close the office door, put up a sign in your cubical for Do Not Disturb - whatever it takes to remove all distractions.&#160; Also, silence any phones in your area (no txt, next chess move alerts, etc).</p>  <p>The problem with New York City when I moved here is I have yet to work in an office with dedicated offices, or even a cubical!&#160; Everyone is squeezed into tight open work areas, and demanded to be at full attention at all hours of the day.&#160; This is a horrible working environment and goes against our basic evolutional bodily functions.&#160; You are yawning at 2pm?&#160; Yeah, no wonder.&#160; All I have to say here is to bring a set of very large headphones, and set a workplace policy that when you have your headphones on, you are to not be disturbed.&#160; Works most of the time actually (even if head laying on the desk).</p>  <p><strong>2. Set an alarm for no longer than 30 minutes.&#160; </strong></p>  <p>You do not want to sleep past 30 minutes, no matter how tired you are.&#160; When the alarm goes off, you must get up - no exceptions.&#160; This is because your body will start to go into REM Stage I sleep at 35 to 40 minutes, and your body will be expecting to go through all 3 stages of REM - over the next 3 to 4 hours.&#160; Your body will start to release the chemicals needed for deep sleep at Stage I, and you don't want any of that.&#160; If your REM cycle is interrupted during any of these stages, well, that's when Mr. Groggy comes out and is introduced to your co-workers.</p>  <p>Tip: the use of a smartphone in your workplace is perfect here.&#160; Set some relaxing meditation music on your phone as well as an alarm on the phone for no longer than 30 minutes.&#160; Just turn off the ringer and text message sounds first.</p>  <p><strong>3. Set the proper conditions.</strong></p>  <p>If it is not possible to set a dark area, bring a sleep mask with you to work.&#160; Also, increase the temp if possible or put on a jacket - even if you are a bit warm already (your body lowers its temp during sleep cycles).&#160; If you cannot use a sleep mask or dim the lights, just lie your forehead on your arms on your desk. </p>  <p><strong>4. Remove all thoughts of stress.&#160; </strong></p>  <p>Do not think about anything related to work, no matter how fun it is.&#160; Think nothing of deadlines or tasks - that only begets an elevated heart rate. Think of the next vacation for the family instead, or your kids next birthday wish, or that hot rod car project: whatever makes you happy.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>If interrupted from slumber…</strong></p>  <p>There are a few rules to follow if you are interrupted by the kids, or co-workers.</p>  <ul>   <li>Get up immediately.&#160; </li>    <li>Do not attempt to go back to the nap for the next 2 to 3 hours.&#160; Anything earlier than that does not work. </li> </ul>  <p>This is why it is important to set the policy that once you are resting, you are at rest.&#160; </p>  <p><strong>Power Naps are not a replacement for the lack of sleep.</strong></p>  <p>One bad night of sleep?&#160; Fine.&#160; Two or more of consecutive bad nights of sleep?&#160; Power naps aren't going to help much.</p>  <p><strong>Tell the boss you are just thinking.</strong></p>  <p>The British study (if I could find it, I would - Binging <em>British Power Nap Studies</em> has an endless supply of links) also concluded that power napping makes you more focused in the 2 to 3 hours after the power nap.&#160; Additional research on the study yielded that people tend to have their best ideas just before and just after Stage I REM.</p>  <p>So the next time your boss asks if you are sleeping on the job, say no and you just are thinking.</p>]]></content>
